<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In the west of Virginia, however, the people were loyal to the Union
and it was here that the first great battles of the war were fought.</p><p>Life in this part of Virginia which lay beyond the Alleghenies was
very different from life in Eastern Virginia.  Western Virginia was
not a land suitable for slaves, and for a long time the people had
desired to part from Eastern Virginia.  Now during the war they had
their wish, and West Virginia became a separate state.  In June,
1863, it was admitted to the Union as the thirty-fifth state.</p><p>The war which had now begun was the most terrible ever fought on
American soil.  For far more even than the War of Independence, it
was a war of kindred.  It made enemies of comrades and brothers.  Men
who had been dear friends suddenly found themselves changed into
ruthless enemies, families even were divided against each other.</p></div> </div>
