"he had the most magnificient face and eyes that I have ever gazed
into.  If he had walked up and down the Confederate line of battle
there would have been no battle.  I was his, body and soul, from
the time I felt the pressure of his fingers."</p><p>The Southerners would have found a friend in Lincoln, but now that
friend was lost to them.  Had he lived much of the bitterness of
the time after the war would never have been.</p><p>President Johnson had a very hard task before him.  He had "to bind
up the nation's wounds" and re-unite the North and South.  But he
had neither the tact nor the strength needed for this great task.
At first it was thought he would be too hard on the South.  Then it
was thought he would be too lenient, and soon he was at loggerheads
with Congress.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For the South, this time was a time of bitterness. </p></div> </div>
