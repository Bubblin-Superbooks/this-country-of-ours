Catholic, faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, as taught by the Roman
Church.  Give up your banners and your arms, and throw yourselves

those on the Spanish side awaited their return.  At length one of
their messengers returned, and going to Menendez he offered him a
large sum of money if he would swear to spare their lives.</p><p>But Menendez would promise nothing.  The Frenchmen were helpless.
