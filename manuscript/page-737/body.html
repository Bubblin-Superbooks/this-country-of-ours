and Washington knew he must keep possession of those heights, if
New York was not to be given up without a blow being struck.  He
did not want to give it up without striking a blow, for he feared
the effect on the spirits of the country.  So he send General Putnam
with about eight thousand men to occupy the Heights.</p><p>In doing this Washington placed his army in a very dangerous position,
for the East River was large enough to allow British war ships to
sail up it and thus cut his army in two.  But he could do nothing
else, for if the enemy got possession of the Heights the town was
at his mercy.</p><p>Howe was not slow to see this, and, having carefully and secretly
made his plans, he attacked the forces on Brooklyn Heights in the
early morning of August 27th in front, and flank, and rear, all at
once.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">One division of the Americans was nearly wiped</p></div> </div>
