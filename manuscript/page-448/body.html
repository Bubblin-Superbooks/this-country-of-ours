against it with all their might.  But at length they gave way and
joined Connecticut.</p><p>The King was angry with Massachusetts, too, not only for protecting
the regicides, but also because of what is known as the Declaration
of Rights.  In this the people of Massachusetts acknowledged the King
as their ruler.  But they also made it plain that so long as they
did not make laws which ran counter to English laws they expected
to be let alone.  This made King Charles angry, and if it had not
been that he was busy fighting with Holland very likely the people
of Massachusetts would have had to suffer for their boldness at
once.  As it was they were left in peace a little longer.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
