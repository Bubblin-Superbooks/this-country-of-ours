from Long Island.  So secretly he gave orders that everything which
could be found in the shape of a boat was to be brought to Brooklyn
Ferry.  They were soon gathered, and at eight o'clock in the evening,
two days after the battle of Long Island, quickly and quietly the
army was ferried across the wide river to the New York side.  All
night the rowers laboured, but the work was by no means finished
when day dawned.  The weather, however, still helped the colonists,
for a thick fog settled over the river and hid what was going on
from the British.  Wounded, prisoners, cannon, stores, horses, were
all ferried over, and when later in the day the British marched
into the deserted camp they found not so much as a crust of bread.</p></div> </div>
