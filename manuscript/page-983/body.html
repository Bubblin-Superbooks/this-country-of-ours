had become famous during the Mexican war, for people did not blame
him for the war.  He had only obeyed orders as a soldier must and
every one admired his bravery and skill.</p><p>He was a rough old soldier, and his men called him Old Rough
and Ready.  And when he first heard that people wanted to make him
President, like Jackson, that other rough old soldier before him,
he simply laughed at the idea.</p><p>"I am not vain enough to think that I am fit to be President," he
said. "I would gladly see some other citizen more worthy chosen
for that high office."</p><p>Old Rough and Ready was a soldier, and nothing but a soldier.
He knew nothing at all about politics, and had never even voted.
However when people insisted that he should be President, he began
rather to like the idea, and at length consented to be a candidate,
and was elected.</p></div> </div>
