he was besieged by office seekers.  They thronged his house, they
stopped him in the street, button-holed him in railway carriages.
They flattered, coaxed, threatened, and made his life a burden.</p><p>But in spite of all this worrying the new President determined to
do what he could to end the "spoils system," and appoint people only
for the sake of the public good.  Accordingly he made many enemies.</p><p>Among the many office-seekers whom the President was forced to
disappoint was a weak-minded, bad young man named Guiteau.  Garfield
saw plainly that he was quite unfit to fill any government post,
and he refused to employ him.  Thereupon Guiteau's heart was filled
with hate against the President.  He brooded over his wrongs till
his hate became madness, and in this madness he determined to kill
his enemy.</p></div> </div>
