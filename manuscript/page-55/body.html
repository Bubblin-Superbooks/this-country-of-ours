and for a long time it was thought to be the island which is still
called San Salvador or Cat Island.  But lately people have come to
believe that Columbus first landed upon an island a little further
south, now called, Watling Island.</p><p>From San Salvador Columbus sailed about and landed upon several
other islands, naming them and taking possession of them for Spain.
He saw many strange and beautiful fruits: "trees of a thousand
sorts, straight and tall enough to make masts for the largest ships
of Spain." He saw flocks of gaily coloured parrots and many other
birds that sang most sweetly.  He saw fair harbours so safe and
spacious that he thought they might hold all the ships of the world.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But of such things Columbus was not in search.  He was seeking for
gold and jewels, and at every place he touched he hoped to find
some great eastern potentate, robed in splendour and seated upon
a golden throne;</p></div> </div>
