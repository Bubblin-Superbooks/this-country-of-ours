destroyed.  So thoroughly was the work done that Burgoyne, in
pursuit, could only march about a mile a day, and had to build no
fewer than forty bridges in a distance of little more than twenty-four
miles.</p><p>Besides destroying the roads Schuyler also made the country a desert.
He carried away and destroyed the crops, drove off the sheep and
cattle, sweeping the country so bare that the hostile army could
find no food, and were forced to depend altogether on their own
supplies.  Before long these gave out, and the British began to
suffer from hunger.</p><p>Burgoyne now learned that at the village of Bennington the patriots
had a depot containing large stores of food and ammunition.  These
he determined to have for his own army, and he sent a force of six
hundred men, mostly Germans and Indians, to make the capture.</p></div> </div>
