was crowded also, and people were even to be seen on the roofs.</p><p>A little after noon Washington reached the hall, and as he stepped
out on to the balcony a cheer of welcome burst from the gathered
thousands.  Again and again they cheered, again and again Washington
bowed in acknowledgement.  He was greatly touched; tears stood in
his eyes, and at length utterly overcome he sat down.</p><p>Suddenly a deep hush fell upon the swaying crowd and after a slight
pause Washington rose again.  Then in the grave silence the voice
of Robert R.  Livingston, the Chancellor of New York, could clearly
be heard.</p><p>"Do you," he asked, "solemnly swear that you will faithfully execute
the office of President of the United States, and will to the best
of your ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of
the United States?"</p></div> </div>
