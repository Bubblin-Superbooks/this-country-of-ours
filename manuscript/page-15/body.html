sun.  For many days they sailed yet they saw no land: nought was
about them but the restless, tossing waves.  But at length one day
to their watching eyes there appeared a faint grey line far on the
horizon.  Then their hearts bounded for joy.  They had not sailed in
vain, for land was near.</p><p>"Surely," said Leif, as they drew close to it, "this is the land
which Bjarni saw.  Let it not be said of us that we passed it by as
he did."</p><p>So, casting anchor, Leif and his companions launched a boat and
went ashore.  But it was no fair land to which they had come.  Far
inland great snow-covered mountains rose, and between them and the
sea lay flat and barren rock, where no grass or green thing grew.
It seemed to Leif and his companions that there was no good thing
in this land.</p><p>"I will call it Helluland or Stone Land," said Leif.</p></div> </div>
