he could not leave his brave friend thus helpless.  So once more
the toilsome journey was begun.  But when Heart-break was reached,
La Salle found no friend to welcome him.  All around there was
nothing but silence and desolation, and ghastly ash-strewn ruins.
The unfinished ship, like some vast skeleton, huge and gaunt, alone
bore witness that white men had once been there.</p><p>Still La Salle would not despair.  He spent the winter making friends
with the Indians and searching earnestly for some trace of Tonty.
The winter was unusually severe, the whole land was covered with
snow and both La Salle and some of his men became snow-blind for
days.  But at last with the melting of the snows light and joy came
to him.  The blindness passed, Tonty was found.</p></div> </div>
