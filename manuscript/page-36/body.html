the country secretly, in fear of the King, and of those to whom he
owed money.</p><p>When Columbus thus fled from Portugal, penniless and in debt, he
was a man over forty.  He was a bitterly disappointed man, too, but
he still clung to his great idea.  So he sent his brother Bartholomew
to England to beg King Henry VII to help him, while he himself
turned towards Spain.  Bartholomew, however, reached England in an
evil hour for his quest.  For Henry VII had but newly wrested the
crown from Richard III, and so had no thought to spare for unknown
lands.  Christopher also arrived in Spain at an unfortunate time.
For the Spaniards were carrying on a fierce warfare against the
Moors, and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had little thought
or money to spare for any other undertaking.  Therefore, although
Ferdinand listened to what Columbus had to say, for the time being
he could promise no help.</p></div> </div>
