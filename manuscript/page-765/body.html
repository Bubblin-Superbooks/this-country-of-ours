<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Benedict Arnold, who had but lately
arrived, volunteering for the service, was soon on his way with
twelve hundred men.  Arnold was ready enough to fight, as he was.  But
he knew that his force was much smaller than that of the British,
and, after some thought, he fell upon a plan by which theirs could
be made less.</p><p>A spy had been caught within the American lines, and was condemned
to death.  He was an almost half-witted creature, with queer cunning
ways, and the Indians looked upon him as a sort of Medicine Man,
and feared him accordingly.  Knowing this, Arnold thought that he
might be useful to him, and promised to spare his life if he would
go to the British camp and spread a report among their Indian allies
that the Americans were coming down upon them in tremendous force.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The man was glad enough to get a chance to escape</p></div> </div>
