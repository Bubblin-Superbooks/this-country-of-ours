daughter Theodosia believed in him and loved him.  He as passionately
loved her, and in all his wanderings he carried her portrait with
him.</p><p>But now the worst misfortunes of his life overtook him.  For a few
weeks after he landed in America, Theodosia wrote to tell him that
her little boy had died.  This was a great grief to Burr, for he
loved his grandson only a little less than his daughter.</p><p>The worst was still to come, however.  Theodosia set out from Carolina
to visit her father.  But the ship in which she sailed never came
to port.  It was never heard of again, and all on board were lost.</p><p>Now at length Burr's head was bowed.  Life held nothing more for
him, and he cared no longer to live.  But death passed him by.  So
