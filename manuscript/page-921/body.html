in 1821.  Mississippi, Illinois and Alabama were framed out of
original territory but Missouri was framed out of the Louisiana
Purchase.  All four names are Indian.  Mississippi and Missouri are
named after the rivers which flow through them, Mississippi meaning
Father of Waters and Missouri Great Muddy.  For the Missouri is
full of yellow mud.  Illinois is named after the tribe of Indians
who lived there.  Their name was really Iliniwok meaning "Men" but
white people pronounced it badly and it became changed to Illinois.
Alabama means "here we rest."</p><p>In 1820 Maine also was admitted as a state.  Maine, however, was
not newly settled country.  Since colonial days it had been a part

Massachusetts, and asked to be admitted to the Union as a separate
state.</p></div> </div>
