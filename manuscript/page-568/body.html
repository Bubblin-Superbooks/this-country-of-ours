you my canoe."</p><p>Mrs.  Fraser was very much frightened when she heard Sanute speak
like this.  But when she told her husband he laughed at her fears.
The idea that the Spaniards should join with the Indians against
the British seemed to him quite absurd.</p><p>"How can the Spaniards go to war with us," he said, "while they
are at peace with Great Britain?"</p><p>"I know not," replied Sanute." But the Spanish Governor has said
that soon there will be a great war between the British and the
Spaniards, and while we attack on land he will send great ships to
block up the harbours, so that neither man nor woman may escape."</p><p>Then laying his hand upon his heart Sanute implored his white friends
to flee with all haste. "But if you are determined to stay," he
added, "then I will take on myself one last office of friendship,
and so that you may not be tortured I will slay you with my own
hand."</p></div> </div>
