United States.</p><p>A party of American soldiers was landed at the town of Sitka.  They
marched to the governor's house, and there were drawn up beside
the Russian troops.  Then the Russian Commander ordered the Russian
flag to be hauled down, and made a short speech.  Thereupon the
soldiers of both countries fired a salute.  The American flag was
run up, and the ceremony was at an end.</p><p>Thus another huge territory was added to the United States.  But at
first many people were displeased at the purchase.  It was a useless
and barren country, they thought, where the winters were so long
and cold that it was quite unfit for a dwelling place for white
men.  But soon it was found that the whale and seal fisheries were
very valuable, and later gold was discovered.  It has also been found
to be rich in other minerals, especially coal, and in timber, and
altogether has proven a useful addition to the country.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
