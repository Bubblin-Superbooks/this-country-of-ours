<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>One of La Salle's great difficulties was lack of money.  So before
leaving the great lakes he collected a quantity of furs.  Then he
sent back the Griffin and half his men, with orders to sell these
furs, and return with supplies for the expedition as quickly as
possible.  With the rest of his men La Salle journeyed on to the
head of Lake Michigan in canoes.</p><p>It was no easy journey, for storms swept the lake.  The waves tossed
their frail canoes hither and thither so that they were often in
danger of drowning.  They were harassed, too, by unfriendly Indians.
At length, worn out by fatigue, starving with cold and hunger, they
reached the appointed place to await the return of the Griffin.</p><p>But the Griffin never came.  In vain La Salle scanned the grey
waters.  Day after day passed, and no white sail flecked the dreary
expanse.  The Griffin was never heard of more.</p></div> </div>
