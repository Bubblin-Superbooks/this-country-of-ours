Far more was done by the privateers, which were fitted out by the
hundred.  They scoured the seas like greyhounds, attacking British
merchantmen on every trade route, capturing and sinking as many
as three hundred in one year.  This kind of warfare paid so well,

prowess.  When the war was over he entered the service of Russia,
and became an admiral.  He died in Paris in 1792, but for a long time
it was not known where he was buried.  His grave was discovered in
1905, and his body was brought to America by a squadron of the navy
which was sent to France for the purpose, and reburied at Annapolis
with the honour due to a hero.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
