be sounded, and when all the men were aroused and stood together
he bade them give thanks to God for their safe arrival.  So standing
beneath the waving palms, with the deep blue sky arching overhead,
the men sang a psalm of thanksgiving and praise.  Then kneeling they
prayed long and earnestly.</p><p>The prayer ended, the men arose, and full of happy courage turned
to their work.  Every one took part with right good will.  Some brought
earth, some cut logs; there was not a man who had not a shovel or
hatchet or some tool in his hand.  The work went on merrily, and
soon above the banks of the river the fort rose, secure and strong,
fenced and entrenched on every side.  In honour of their King Charles
these new colonists called their fort Caroline, just as Ribaut had
called his Charlesfort.</p></div> </div>
