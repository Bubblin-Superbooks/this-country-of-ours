<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>It was just at this time when the Fugitive Slave Law was being
enforced, and the Underground Railroad was working nightly that
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was written and published.  You all know the
story of poor old Tom, of funny, naughty Topsy and all the other
interesting people of the book.  We look upon it now as merely a
story-book.  But it was much more than that.  It was a great sermon
and did more to make people hate slavery than any other book ever
written.</p><p>It was read by hundreds and thousands of people, and soon the fame
of it spread to every country in Europe, and it was translated
into at least twenty languages.  And even today when the work it
was meant to do is done, hundreds of boys and girls still laugh at
Topsy and feel very choky indeed over the fate of poor old Uncle
Tom.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
