both Key and his friend must wait until the attack was over.</p><p>So, from the British fleet, Key watched the bombardment of Fort
McHenry which guarded the town.  All through the night the guns
roared and flashed, and in the lurid light Key could see the flag
on Fort McHenry fluttering proudly.  But before dawn the firing
