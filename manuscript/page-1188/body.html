we cannot say.  The trouble is too close to us.  It is not settled yet.
But the one thing we can clearly see is that Mr.  Wilson loved and
desired peace, not only with Mexico but with the whole of America.
He wanted to unite the whole of America, both North and South, in
bonds of kindness.  He wanted to make the small weak republics of
South America feel that the great republic of North America was
a watchful friend, and not a watchful enemy, eager, and able when
she chose, to crush them.  Had the United States put forth her
strength, Mexico could have been conquered, doubtless, in no long
time.  But Mr.  Wilson took a wider view than those who counseled such
a course. </p></div> </div>
