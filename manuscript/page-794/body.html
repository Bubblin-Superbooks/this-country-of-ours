with him, he sighted a whole fleet of merchantmen off the coast
of England and at once gave chase.  The merchantmen were being
convoyed by two British men-of-war, the Serapis and the Countess of
Scarborough, and they at once got between Jones and his prey.  Then
the merchantmen made off as fast as they could, and the men-of-war
came on.  Presently the captain of the Serapis hailed the Bonhomme
Richard.</p><p>"What ship are you?" he shouted.</p><p>"I can't hear what you say," replied Jones, who wanted to get
nearer.</p><p>That made the British captain suspicious.  Nearer and nearer the
two vessels drew on to each other.</p><p>"Hah," he said, "it is probably Paul Jones.  If so there is hot work
ahead."</p><p>Again the Serapis sent a hail.</p></div> </div>
