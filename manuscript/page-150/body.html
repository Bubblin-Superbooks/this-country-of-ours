<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">they had seen a French ship wrecked a little to
the south.</p><p>The news delighted Menendez, and he at once set out to capture the
shipwrecked men.  It was not long before he saw the lights of the
French camp in the distance.  But on coming nearer it was seen that
they were on the other side of an arm of the sea, so that it was
impossible to reach them.  Hiding, therefore, in the bushes by the
water's edge Menendez and his men watched the Frenchmen on the other
side.  The Spaniards soon saw that their enemies were in distress.
They suspected that they were starving, for they could be seen
walking up and down the shore seeking shellfish.  But Menendez
wanted to make sure of the state they were in, and he made up his
mind to get nearer to the Frenchmen.  So he put off his fine clothes,
and dressing himself like a common sailor, got into a boat and
rowed across the water.</p></div> </div>
