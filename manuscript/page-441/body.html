these messengers.  In reality he did nothing to help, but hindered
them, rather.  News of the search for the fugitives soon reached
New Haven, and at once the people there helped them to hide.  For
their minister, John Davenport, had bidden them to "hide the outcasts
and betray not him that wandereth."</p><p>Goffe and Whalley knew that the people of New Haven would not betray
them.  But lest their enemies should gain any inkling of their being
there they left the town and, going to another, showed themselves

house.  But soon that refuge became no longer safe, for the men in
search of them had, in spite of their strategy, traced them to New
Haven and set out to arrest them.</p></div> </div>
