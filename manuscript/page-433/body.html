in the fire, others who fled from it were cut down by the Englishmen,
or escaping them, fell into the hands of their own countrymen.  They
found no mercy, for they had given none; and, remembering the awful
tortures which their fellow-countrymen had suffered, the Englishmen
had no compassion on their murderers.</p><p>Ere an hour had passed the fight was over.  Out of four hundred
Indians not more than five escaped.  The Pequots were utterly wiped
out and their village a heap of smoking ruins.  Never before had
such terrible vengeance overtaken any Indian tribe.  And all the
other tribes were so frightened and amazed that for forty years
there was peace in New England.  For no Redmen dare attack these
terrible conquerors.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
