was William Pitt, known as the Great Commoner.  He was, it has been
said, the first Englishman of his time, and he made England the
first country in the world.  He was a great judge of men, and he
had a happy way of choosing the right man for the right place.  So

over the world. "We are forced to ask every morning," said a witty
man of the time, "what victory there has been for fear of missing
one."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In America Louisburg fell once more into the hands of the British.
Fort Duquesne too was taken, and the misery of Braddock's disaster
was wiped out.  Then in honour of the great statesman the name of
the fort was changed to Pittsburg.  It is still called by that name
and is now one of the world's greatest manufacturing cities;</p></div> </div>
