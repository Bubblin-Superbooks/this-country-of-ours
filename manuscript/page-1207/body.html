He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.</p><p>He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
O, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet,â€”

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make me free,
While God is marching on."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
