dedicated.  And there President Lincoln made one of his most beautiful
and famous speeches.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Fourscore and seven years ago," he said, "our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are equal.  Now we are
engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.  We are
met on a great battlefield of that war.  We have come to dedicate a
portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here
gave their lives that that nation might live.  It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense
we cannot dedicate - we cannot consecrate - we cannot hollow - this
ground.  The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.  The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but
it can never forget</p></div> </div>
