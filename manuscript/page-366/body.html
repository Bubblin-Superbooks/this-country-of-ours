But many more troubles and miseries were in store for them.  For
hundreds of miles the country lay barren and untilled, inhabited
only by wild Redmen, the nearest British settlement being five
hundred miles away.  There was no one upon the shore to greet them,
no friendly lights, no smoke arising from cheerful cottage fires,
no sign of habitation far or near.  It was a silent frost-bound
coast upon which they had set foot.</p><p>The weather was bitterly cold and the frost so keen that even
their clothes were frozen stiff.  And ere these Pilgrims could find
a shelter from the winter blasts, trees had to be felled and hewn
for the building of their houses.  It was enough to make the stoutest
heart quake.  Yet not one among this little band of Pilgrims flinched
or thought of turning back.  They were made of sterner stuff than
that, and they put all their trust in God.</p></div> </div>
