<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">little vessel
called the Matthew, with a crew of but eighteen men, sailed out
from Bristol harbour.  Many people came to see the vessel sail.  For
they were nearly all Bristol men who were thus venturing forth on
the unknown deep, and their friends crowded to the harbour to wish
them godspeed.</p><p>It was a great occasion for Bristol, and indeed for all England,
for it was the first voyage of discovery with which the English
king and people had to do.  So the tiny whitesailed ship put out to
sea, followed by the prayers and wishes of those left behind.  With
tear-dimmed eyes they watched it till it faded from view.  Then they
turned homewards to pray for the return of their loved ones.</p><p>Round the coast of Ireland the vessel sped.  But at last its green
shores faded from sight and the little company of eighteen brave
men were alone upon the trackless waves.</p></div> </div>
