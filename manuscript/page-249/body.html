Smith found his position of President even more difficult than
before.  Still, for a time, if he could not keep them altogether in
order he at least kept them in check.</p><p>Then one day by a terrible accident his rule was brought to a sudden
end.  He was returning from an expedition up the James River when,
through some carelessness, a bag of gunpowder in his boat was
exploded.  Smith was not killed by it, but he was sorely hurt.  In
great pain, and no longer able to think and act for others, he was
carried back to Jamestown.</p><p>Here there was no doctor of any kind, and seeing himself then only
a useless hulk, and in danger of death, Smith gave up his post,
and leaving the colony, for which during two and a half years he
had worked and thought and fought so hard, he sailed homeward.</p></div> </div>
