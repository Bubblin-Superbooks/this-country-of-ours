it was his sole ambition, he said, "to fight a battle under the
new flag, which will teach the world that the American flag means
something afloat, and must be respected at sea." But he never liked
the yellow flag.  It was more fit for a pirate ship, he thought,
than to be the ensign of a great nation, and he it was who first
sailed under the Stars and Stripes, which he hoisted on his little
ship, the Ranger.  This was only a vessel of three hundred tons.  In
it in November, 1777, he crossed the Atlantic, harried the coasts
of England and Scotland, and then made his way to France.</p><p>From France Jones set out again with a little fleet of four ships.
His flagship he called Bonhomme Richard, as a compliment both to
France and Franklin.  Franklin being the author of "Poor Richard's
Almanac," for which Bonhomme Richard was the French translation.</p></div> </div>
