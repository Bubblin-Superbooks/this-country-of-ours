sinner come before us.  Call Mr.  Bacon."</p><p>The doors were thrown wide open and in marched Bacon, tall and
proud, looking grave indeed but little like a repentant sinner.
At the bar of the House he knelt on one knee, and reading from a
paper written out for him confessed his crimes, begging pardon from
God, the King, and the Governor.</p><p>When his clear young voice ceased the old Governor spoke.</p><p>"God forgive you," he said, solemnly. "I forgive you." Three times
he repeated the words and was silent.</p><p>"And all that were with him?" asked one of the council.</p><p>"Yea," said the Governor, "and all that were with him."</p><p>Thus the matter seemed ended.  There was peace again and the House
could now proceed to further business.</p></div> </div>
