later.</p><p>As to Louisiana, a new set of stories were told of it.  Now it was
no longer described as a sort of earthly paradise, but as a place
of horror and misery.  It was a land of noisome marsh and gloomy
forest, where prowled every imaginable evil beast.  At certain times
of the year the river flooded the whole land, so that the people
were obliged to take refuge in the trees.  There they lived more
like monkeys than men, springing from tree to tree in search of
food.  The sun was so hot that it could strike a man dead as if with
a pistol.  This was called sunstroke.  Luscious fruits indeed grew
around, but they were all poisonous and those who ate of them died
in agonies.  In fact Louisiana was now pictured as a place to be
shunned, as a place of punishment. "Be good or I will send you to
the Mississippi" was a threat terrible enough to make the naughtiest
child obedient.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Mississippi bubble burst, - but still France clung</p></div> </div>
