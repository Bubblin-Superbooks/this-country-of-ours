water, our lodging castles in the air."</p><p>There was fish enough in the river, game enough in the woods.  But
the birds and beasts were so wild, and the men so unskilful and
ignorant in ways of shooting and trapping, that they succeeded
in catching very little.  Besides which there were few among the
colonists who had any idea of what work meant.  More than half the
company were "gentlemen adventurers," dare devil, shiftless men who
had joined the expedition in search of excitement with no idea of
labouring with their hands.</p><p>Badly fed, unused to the heat of a Virginian summer the men soon
fell ill.  Their tents were rotten, their houses yet unbuilt.  Trees
remained unfelled, the land untilled, while the men lay on the bare
ground about the fort groaning and in misery.  Many died, and soon
those who remained were so feeble that they had scarce strength
to bury the dead or even to crawl to the "common kettle" for their
daily measure of porridge.</p></div> </div>
