the Confederacy.  But he was disappointed.  For if the Marylanders
had not much enthusiasm for the Union cause they had still less

the Confederates, and the battle of Antietam, one of the fiercest
of the war, although hardly a victory for the Federals, was equal
to a defeat for the Confederates.  For fourteen hours the carnage
lasted, and when at length night put an end to the slaughter
thousands lay dead on either side.  Next day, having in a fortnight
lost half his army, Lee withdrew once more into Virginia.</p><p>Lincoln's chief object in carrying on the war was not to free
