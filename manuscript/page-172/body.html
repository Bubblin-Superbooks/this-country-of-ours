The English, therefore, looked upon the French as interlopers and
usurpers.  The French, however, paid little attention to the English

an Englishman, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, determined also to plant one
in North America.</p><p>He was the first Englishman ever to attempt to found a colony in

they had only gone in quest of gold and of adventures, and without
any thought of founding a New England across the seas.  This now,
with Queen Elizabeth's permission, was what Sir Humphrey hoped to
do.</p></div> </div>
