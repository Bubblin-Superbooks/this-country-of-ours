began to be thought of.  The first Congress had met at New York, but
it only remained there a short time.  Then the seat of government
was moved to Philadelphia.  Philadelphia, however, was not considered
a good place.  So it was decided to build a new capital.  The Northern
States wanted it in the north, the Southern States wanted it in
the south, but finally it was agreed upon to have it on the Potomac
River almost in the middle, Virginia and Maryland offering the
territory.  Splendid plans were made, and the building was begun,
but for the next ten years Philadelphia still remained the seat of
government.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So four busy years went past, and the time of Washington's presidency

his country he could now go back to his peaceful home at Mount
Vernon, and be at rest.  But his friends would not let him go. </p></div> </div>
