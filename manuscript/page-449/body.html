Indians when they first arrived.  As long as the old Chief Massasoit
lived he kept that treaty.  But now he was dead, and his son Philip
ruled.</p><p>You will wonder, perhaps, why an Indian chief should have a name
like Philip.  But Philip's real name was Metacomet.  He, however,
wanted to have an English name, and to please him the English called
him Philip.  And by that name he is best known.</p></div> </div>
