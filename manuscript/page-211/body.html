were many who quite agreed that Captain John Smith was a turbulent
fellow.  So to keep him quiet they clapped him in irons and kept him
so until their arrival in Virginia.  After leaving the West Indies
the adventurers fell into more bad weather, and lost their course;
but finally they arrived safely in Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>They named the capes on either side Henry and Charles, in honour
of the two sons of their King.  Upon Cape Henry they set up a brass
cross upon which was carved "Jacobus Rex" and thus claimed the
land for England.  Then they sailed on up the river which they named
James River, in honour of the King himself.  Their settlement they
named Jamestown, also in his honour.  Jamestown has now disappeared,
but the two capes and the river are still called by the names given
them by these early settlers.</p></div> </div>
