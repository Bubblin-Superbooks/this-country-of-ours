he resolved to punish the people of Boston. "They will be lions,"
he said, "as long as we are lambs, but if we show them that we mean
to be firm they will soon prove very meek."</p><p>So he closed the port and forbade any ships to go there, thus
cutting off Boston from the trade of the world.  He also said that
Boston should no longer be the capital of Massachusetts, and made
Salem the capital instead.</p><p>Boston, of course, was well-nigh ruined by these acts.  But instead
of looking coldly on her misfortunes, the other colonies rallied
to her aid.  And grain, cattle and all sorts of merchandise poured
into Boston from them.</p><p>Boston could not be starved, neither could it be frightened into
submitting.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
