were not at all pleased to have such powerful Churchmen for their
neighbours.</p><p>As has been said, land grants often overlapped, and part of the
land granted to Gorges and Mason was also claimed by Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts colonists insisted on their rights.  Both Gorges
and Mason therefore became their enemies, and did their best

saw the end of freedom, the beginning of tyranny.  Both Gorges and
his friend Mason were zealous Churchmen and the Puritans felt sure
would try to force them all to become Churchmen</p></div> </div>
