coast, and get away in some ship.  He had still many friends, and
one night he stopped at a cottage to ask his way to the house of
one of these friends.  In the cottage were two young men.  One of
them, named Perkins, looked keenly at the stranger.  It seemed to
him that his face and clothes were not in keeping, and his boots
