and that night the army slept on the field.  He himself slept under
a tree, sharing a cloak with Lafayette.  But the battle was never
renewed, for during the night Clinton marched quietly away.  When

and a few weeks later Washington took up his quarters on White
Plains.  There for nearly three years he stayed, guarding the great
waterway of the Hudson, and preventing the British from making any
further advance in the north.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
