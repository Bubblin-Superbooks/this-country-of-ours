had a governor.  And in all the early years there was trouble between
the governors and the people.  Sometimes the governors were good
men, but more often they were rascals who cared for nothing but
their own pockets.  So we hear of revolutions, of governors being
deposed and imprisoned, of colonists going to England to complain
of their governors, of governors going to complain of the colonists.</p><p>But far worse than the quarrel between people and governor were
the troubles with the Indians.  Many thousands of white people had
by this time settled in the Carolinas, and the Redman saw himself
year by year being driven further and further from his old hunting
grounds; so year by year his anger grew.  At first he had been
friendly to the white man because he brought with him beads and
copper ornaments and "fire water." But now he began to hate him.</p></div> </div>
