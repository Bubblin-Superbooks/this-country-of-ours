difficulties.  But at length they all seemed to be overcome, and he
set out with his friend, Henri de Tonty, and about forty men.</p><p>Tonty was a man of courage, as bold and enterprising as La Salle
himself.  He was, too, much feared by the Indians, who thought him
a great Medicine Man.  For while fighting in Europe he had had one
hand shot off.  But he had replaced it with an iron hand, which he
always wore covered with a glove.  The Indians did not know this,
and once or twice when they had been troublesome he had brought
them to order by knocking them down with this hand.  Not knowing the
secret of it they marvelled greatly at his strength, and, fearing
him accordingly, called him Iron Hand.</p></div> </div>
