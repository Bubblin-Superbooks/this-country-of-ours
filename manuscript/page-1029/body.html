began.  Half a hundred cannon roared against the fort, shells screamed
and fell, and the walls were quickly shattered.  The barracks took
fire, and after two days it became utterly impossible to resist
longer.</p><p>So Major Anderson yielded, and with his brave company marched out

of the terrific firing, not a life had been lost on either side.</p><p>Both North and South now began to arm.  But when the President

Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia, and instead of
gathering troops to help the Government they joined the Confederates.

was made President of the Confederacy, which included eleven states.</p></div> </div>
