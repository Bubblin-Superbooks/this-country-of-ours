<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>This first expedition to Roanoke was only for exploring, and after
a little the adventurers sailed home again to tell of all that they
had seen.  But Raleigh was so pleased with the report of Roanoke
Island which they brought home, to him that he at once began to
make plans for founding a colony there.  And the following April
his ships, were ready and the expedition set out under his cousin,
Sir Richard Grenville.</p><p>But now almost as soon as they landed troubles began with the
Indians.  One of them stole a silver cup, and as it was not returned
the Englishmen in anger set fire to the corn-fields and destroyed
them.  This was a bad beginning.  But the Englishmen had no knowledge
yet of how cruel and revengeful the Redman could be.  So it was with
no misgivings that Sir Richard left a colony of over a hundred men
in the country.  And promising to return with fresh supplies in the
following spring he sailed homeward.</p></div> </div>
