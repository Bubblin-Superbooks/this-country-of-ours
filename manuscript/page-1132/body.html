Lincoln, he came of very poor people.  He taught himself how to
read, but could not write until after his marriage, when his wife
taught him.  In many ways he thought as Lincoln did, but he had none
of Lincoln's wonderful tact in dealing with men, he could not win
men's love as Lincoln had done.</p></div> </div>
