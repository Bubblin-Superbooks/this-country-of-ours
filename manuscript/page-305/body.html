very pleased with Sandys, decided to elect him again.  But when King
James heard that, he was very angry.  He called the company a school
of treason and Sandys his greatest enemy.  Then, flinging himself
out of the room in a terrible passion, he shouted "Choose the Devil

Edwin's heading the list.  But just as the voting was about to begin
