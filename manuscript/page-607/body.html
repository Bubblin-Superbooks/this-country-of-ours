to last for seventy years; a struggle in which not only the white
people but the Indians also took part, some fighting for the British,
some for the French.</p><p>King William's War, 1690-1697 At this time Frontenac was Governor
of Canada.  He was one of the greatest nobles of France and lived
surrounded with state and splendour.  Proud and haughty and of a
fiery temper, with white men he quarreled often, but he knew better
than any other how to manage the Indians, and they feared him as
they feared no white ruler who came before or after him.  He would
not allow the chiefs to call him brother as other governors had
done.  They were his children; to them he was the Great Father.  Yet
if need be he would paint his face, dress himself in Indian clothes,
and, tomahawk in his hand, lead the war dance, yelling and leaping
with the best of them.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">King Louis now gave Frontenac orders to seize New</p></div> </div>
