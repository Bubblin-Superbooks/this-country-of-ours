<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>When the news that Louisburg was taken reached New England the
people rejoiced.  Bells were rung, cannons were fired and bonfires
blazed in all the chief towns.  In England itself the news was received
with surprise and delight, and Pepperell, the merchant-soldier,
was made a baronet and could henceforth call himself Sir William
Pepperell.</p><p>But when the French heard that they had lost their splendid American
fortress they were filled with dismay.  One after another, three
expeditions were sent to recapture it, but one after another they
miscarried.  And when at length, in 1748, peace was agreed upon,
Louisburg was still in the hands of the New Englanders.  The peace
which was now signed is called the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.  By it,
it was agreed that each side should give back all its conquests,
so that after all the terrible loss and bloodshed neither side was
one whit the better.</p></div> </div>
