<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>One Saturday the Royalists reached Guilford, not sixteen miles
away.  Here they demanded horses from the Governor to take them on
to New Haven.  But the Governor had little desire to help them.  So
with one excuse after another he put them off until it was too late
to start that night.  The next day was Sunday, and it was strictly
against the laws of Puritan New England to ride or drive on Sunday
save to church.  So the Royalist messengers, chafing with impatience,
might bribe and command as much as they liked; not a man would stir
a hand to help them till Monday morning.</p><p>Meanwhile a messenger was speeding on his way to New Haven to warn
the Parliamentarians.  And while their pursuers were kicking their
heels in enforced idleness they slipped away, and found a new hiding
place in a mill some miles off.  But even this was thought not to
be safe, and they fled once more, and at length found refuge in a
cave deep in the forest.</p></div> </div>
