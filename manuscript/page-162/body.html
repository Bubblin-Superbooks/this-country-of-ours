forts saw three ships go sailing by.  These were the French ships
bringing Gourges and his companions.  But the men in the forts
thought that they were Spanish ships and therefore fired a salute.
Gourges did not undeceive them.  He fired a salute in reply and,
sailing on as if he were going elsewhere, was soon lost to sight.</p><p>At length, having found a. convenient place out of sight of
the forts, he drew to the shore.  But when he would have landed he
saw that the whole beach was crowded with savages armed with bows
and arrows and ready for war.  For the Indians, too, had taken the
strange ships to be Spanish.  And as they had grown to hate the
Spaniards with a deadly hatred they were prepared to withstand
their landing.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Fortunately, however, Gourges had on board a trumpeter who had been
in Florida with Laudonniï¿½re.  So now he sent him on shore to talk
with the Indians. </p></div> </div>
