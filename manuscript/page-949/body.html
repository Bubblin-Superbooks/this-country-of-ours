Tippecanoe?  With an arm that is strong and a heart that is true,
The man of the people is Tippecanoe."</p><p>That is the beginning of one song and there were dozens more like
it.</p><p>And while the old farmer of Tippecanoe was said to be everything
that was good and honest and lovable, Van Buren on the other hand
was represented as being a bloated aristocrat, who sat in chairs
that cost six hundred dollars, ate off silver plates with golden
forks and spoons, and drove about in an English coach with a haughty
smile on his face.</p><p>It was a time of terrible excitement, and each side gave the
other many hard knocks.  But in the end Harrison was elected by two
hundred and thirty-four electoral votes to Van Buren's sixty.  As
Vice-President John Tyler was chosen. "Tippecanoe and Tyler too"
had been one of the election cries.</p></div> </div>
