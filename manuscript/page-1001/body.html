<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Now said Douglas, "why make all
this fuss about slavery or no slavery every time a new state wants
to be admitted? Do away with this Missouri Compromise, and when there
are enough people in a territory to allow of its being admitted as
a state, let these people themselves decide whether they wish it
to be a free state or a slave state."</p><p>The bill which Douglas brought in thus to do away with the Missouri
Compromise was known as the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, as Douglas
suggested calling the great unorganised territory Nebraska in the
north and Kansas in the South.</p><p>Douglas was a Northern man, but he wanted to please the Southerners,
and get them to vote for him as President.  So he brought in this
bill.  It met the fierce opposition from the North, but it passed.
The President alone had power to stop it.  But he did not use his
power.</p></div> </div>
