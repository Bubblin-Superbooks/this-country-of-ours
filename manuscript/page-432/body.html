Englishmen were left to attack seven hundred Indians.</p><p>A little before dawn they reached the fort.  The Indians were
all sleeping and keeping no guard, so the Englishmen quietly took
possession of both entrances to the fort.</p><p>Then suddenly through the still morning air the sharp sound of a

sleep yelling in terror.  They scarce had time to seize their bows
and arrows when, sword in hand, the Englishmen stormed into the
fort.  A fierce fight followed, showers of arrows fell upon the
Englishmen, but they did little hurt, and glanced off for the most
part harmless from their thick buff coats and steel corslets.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">During the fight some of the huts were set on fire, and soon the
whole village was a roaring mass of flames. </p></div> </div>
