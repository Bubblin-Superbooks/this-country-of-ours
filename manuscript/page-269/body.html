the Pale-faces are lost, or have been stolen from me.  But if the
Pale-faces will give back my daughter I will give satisfaction
for all the other things I have taken, together with five hundred
bushels of corn, and will make peace forever."</p><p>But the Englishmen were not easily deceived.  They returned a message
to the chief saying, "Your daughter is well used.  But we do not
believe the rest of our arms are either lost or stolen, and therefore
until you send them we will keep your daughter."</p><p>The Powhatan was so angry when he got this message that for a long
time he would have no further dealings with the Pale-faces, but
continued to vex and harass them as much as he could.</p><p>At length Sir Thomas Dale, seeking to put an end to this, took
Pocahontas, and with a hundred and fifty men sailed up the river
to the Powhatan's chief town.</p></div> </div>
