<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>It was just about the same time that Missouri was also asking to
be admitted as a state.  And strangely enough the admission of these
two states became connected with each other.  We must look back a
little to see how.</p><p>You remember that two hundred years before this, slaves were first
brought to Virginia.  In those days no one thought that slavery
was wrong.  So as colony was added to colony they also became slave
owners.  But gradually many people began to think that slavery was
a great evil, and every now and again one colony or another would
try to put it down.  But these attempts always ended in failure.</p><p>In the northern states, however, there were few slaves.  For in
these northern states there was not much that slaves could do which
could not be done just as well by white men.  So it did not pay to
keep slaves, and gradually slavery was done away with.</p></div> </div>
