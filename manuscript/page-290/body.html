board Captain Argall's boat, the George, and indeed set sail from
London, but before she reached Gravesend she became so ill that
she had to be taken ashore, and there she died.  She was buried in
the chancel of the Parish Church.  Later the Church was burned down,
but it was rebuilt, and as a memorial to Pocahontas American ladies

Thomas behind him in the care of an uncle.  He remained in England
until he was grown up, and then went to his native land.  There he
married, and had a daughter, and became the ancestor of several

from beautiful Pocahontas and her English husband.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
