in Europe.  In America it is called Queen Anne's War, and in Europe
the War of the Spanish Succession.</p><p>Queen Anne's War, 1702-1713 This war was carried on in much the same
manner as the last.  There were Indian massacres, sudden sallies,
attacks by land and sea.  But this time the British were more
determined.  And although another attack on Quebec failed, just as
the attack made by Phips had failed, one on Nova Scotia succeeded.</p><p>In the South, too, the Spaniards were defeated at Charleston.  Taken
altogether the British had the best of the fighting.  And when at
length peace was made by the Treaty of Utrect in 1713 Nova Scotia,
Newfoundland, and the Hudson Bay Territory were given up to the
British.  Thus both in west and north the British enclosed the French
possessions.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
