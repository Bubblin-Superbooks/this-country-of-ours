no longer looked for, when it was indeed unwelcome to many.  For

was to be preferred before the freedom and the misery of Florida.</p><p>But to abandon the colony was now impossible, for besides supplies
of food the French ships had brought many new colonists.  This
time, too, the men had not come alone but had brought their wives
and families with them.  Soon the fort which had been so silent and
mournful was filled with sounds of talk and laughter.  Again, the
noise of hatchet and hammer resounded through the woods, and the
little forsaken corner of the world awoke once more to life.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
