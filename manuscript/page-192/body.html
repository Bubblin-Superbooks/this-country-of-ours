a week after they had sailed away, a ship arrived laden "with all
manner of things in most plentiful manner for the supply and relief
of his colony."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For some time the ship beat up and down the coast searching vainly
for the colony.  And at length finding no sign of it, it returned to
England.  About a fortnight later Sir Richard Grenville also arrived
with three ships.  To his astonishment when he reached Roanoke he
saw no sign of the ship which he knew had sailed shortly before
him.  And to his still greater astonishment he found the colony
deserted.  Yet he could not believe that it had been abandoned.  So
he searched the country up and down in the hope of finding some of
the colonists.  But finding no trace of them he at length gave up
the search and returned to the forsaken huts.  And being unwilling
to lose possession of the country, he determined to leave some of
his men there.  So fifteen men were left behind, well provided with
everything</p></div> </div>
