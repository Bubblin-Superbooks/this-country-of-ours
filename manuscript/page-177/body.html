belonging to some other adventurers.  It was laden with fish and
ready to depart homeward.  In this they sailed away leaving its
owners behind.</p><p>The rest of Sir Humphrey's men now clamoured more than ever to be
taken home.  And at length he yielded to them.  But the company was
now much smaller than when he set out.  For besides those who had
stolen away, many had died and many more were sick.  There were not
enough men to man all four ships.  So the Swallow was left with the
sick and a few colonists who wished to remain, and in the other
three Sir Humphrey put to sea with the rest of his company.</p><p>He did not, however, sail straight homeward.  For he wanted to explore
still further, and find, if he could, an island to the south which
he had heard was very fertile.  But the weather was stormy, and
before they had gone far the Delight was wrecked, and nearly all
on board were lost.</p></div> </div>
