the time during which he was President was called the "era of good
feeling."</p><p>And indeed men were so glad of this time of peace which had come
after such long years of war that they forgot old quarrels and
became friends again.</p><p>Unfortunately the peace was broken by a war with the Seminole
Indians in Florida.  Florida still belonged to Spain, and it became
a haunt for all sorts of adventurers.  These adventurers robbed,
and murdered, and created terrible disturbances among the Indians,
until along the frontier between Georgia and Florida there was
neither safety nor peace for any white man.</p><p>So the President at length sent General Jackson, who had won great
fame in the War of 1812, to bring the Indians to order.  Jackson
marched into Florida, and in three months' time had subdued the
Indians, brought order out of wild disorder, and in fact conquered
Florida.</p></div> </div>
