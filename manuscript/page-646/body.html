<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The American soldiers fared better.  For as soon as they were attacked
they scattered, and from behind the shelter of trees fought the
Indians in their own fashion.  Some of the British tried to do the
same.  But Braddock had no knowledge of savage warfare.  To fight in
such a manner seemed to him shocking.  It was unsoldierly; it was
cowardly.  So he swore savagely at his men, calling them cowards,
and beat them back into line with the flat of his sword.  And thus
huddled together they stood a brilliant, living target for the
bullets of the savages.</p><p>Braddock himself fought with fury.  He dashed here and there, swearing,
commanding, threatening.  Four horses were shot under him, and at
last he himself fell wounded to death.</p><p>Washington too fought with fearless bravery, trying to carry out
Braddock's frenzied orders.  And although he escaped unhurt his
clothes were riddled with holes, and twice his horse was shot under
him.</p></div> </div>
