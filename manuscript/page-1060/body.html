Rouge, the state capital.  So at length the Federals had control
of the whole lower river as far as Vicksburg.  The upper river from
Cairo was also secure to the Federals.  Thus save for Vicksburg the
whole valley was in their hands, and the Confederacy was practically
cut in two.</p><p>But Vicksburg stood firm for the South.  When called upon to
surrender the governor refused. "I have to state," he said, "that
Mississippians do not know, and refuse to learn, how to surrender
to an enemy.  If Commodore Farragut, or Brigadier General Butler,
can teach them, let them come and try."</p><p>At the time soldiers enough could not be spared to help the fleet
to take Vicksburg.  So for the time being it was left alone.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
