every village green the farmers might be seen drilling every evening.
Bands of minute men, that is, men who would be ready at a minute's
notice, were organised.  All sorts of war stores were gathered.</p><p>Two of the leaders of the people in all these matters were Samuel
Adams and John Hancock.  These men Governor Gage, who was also
commander of the troops, was ordered to arrest and send to England
to be tried as traitors.  Gage having heard that both men were
staying at the village of Lexington decided to arrest them together.</p><p>For this he carefully laid his plans.  Eight hundred men were to
leave Boston in secret at dead of night.  First they were to go to
Lexington, and having arrested the "traitors" they were next to
march on to Concord to seize the large war stores which were known
to be gathered there.</p></div> </div>
