England.  Two months of storm and danger passed before the adventurers
sighted the West Indies.  Here they went ashore on the island of
San Dominica.  Delighted once more to see land and escape from the

decided to end both quarrels and John Smith.  So he ordered a gallows
to be set up and, having accused Smith of mutiny, made ready to
hang him.  But John Smith stoutly defended himself.  Nothing could be
proved against him.  He laughed at the gallows, and as he quaintly
puts it "could not be persuaded to use them."</p></div> </div>
