beside him Washington replied.</p><p>"I do solemnly swear," he said, "that I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of
my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the
United States."</p><p>Then bowing his head he kissed the Bible help before him. "So help
me God," he murmured.</p><p>The Chancellor then stepped forward and in a ringing voice he shouted,
"Long live George Washington, President of the United States."</p><p>A great answering shout went up from the people, the flag was
broken to the breeze, and cannon boomed forth a salute to the first
President of the United States.</p><p>Again and again Washington bowed his thanks to the cheering people.
