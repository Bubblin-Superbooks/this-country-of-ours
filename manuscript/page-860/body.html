<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Thomas Jefferson was the next President - the first to be inaugurated
in the new capital.  He had been Vice-President with Adams, and was
already well known in politics.  It was he who wrote the Declaration
of Independence, and he was in every way one of the greatest statesmen
of his time.  He was a lanky, sweet-tempered, sandy coloured man.
He wore badly fitting clothes, and hated ceremony of all kinds.  He
was quite determined not to have any fuss over his inauguration, so
dressed as plainly as possible, he rode to the Capitol by himself,
tied his horse to the palings and walked into the Senate Chamber
alone, just like any ordinary man.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This lack of ceremony he kept up throughout all the time he was
President.  Indeed he sometimes overdid it and offended people.  Once
the British Minister was to be presented to him and went dressed
in his grandest uniform.  But to his disgust he found Jefferson in
the very shabbiest of clothes, and slippers down at the heel. </p></div> </div>
