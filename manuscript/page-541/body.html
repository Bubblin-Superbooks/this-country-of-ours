of colonists came flocking to the new colony.  It grew faster than
any other colony, so fast indeed that houses could not be built
quickly enough.  So for a time many of the new settlers had to live
in caves dug out of the banks of the Delaware River.  It was in one
of these caves that the first baby citizen of the city of brotherly
love was born.</p><p>Pennsylvania prospered and grew fast, but there were constant troubles
with Lord Baltimore about the border line between his province and
Penn's.  The British Kings in those days gave land charters in the
most reckless fashion and over and over again the boundaries of
one province overlapped those of the others.  Then of course there
was trouble.  This had happened with Virginia and Maryland.  Now it
happened with Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p></div> </div>
