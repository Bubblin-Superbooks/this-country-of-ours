to steer a ship, and being caught in a current it was cast upon a
sand-bank and wrecked.  By good luck every one was saved and landed
upon the island of Haiti.  But Columbus had now only one little
vessel, and it was not large enough to carry all the company.  Many

wanted to stay there, and they had often asked the Admiral's leave
to do so.</p><p>Columbus therefore now determined to allow some of his men to
remain to found a little colony, and trade with the Indians, "and
he trusted in God that when he came back from Spain - as he intended
to do - he would find a ton of gold collected by them, and that
they would have found a gold mine, and such quantities of spices
that the Sovereigns would in the space of three years be able to
undertake a Crusade and conquer the Holy Sepulchre."</p></div> </div>
