found himself insulted at every turn.  He was mobbed, and stoned,
and called "Dog Driver," "General Hog" and other ugly names.</p><p>Meanwhile on the stormy seas the ships bringing out the new Governor
and Lieutenant-Governor were being tossed hither and thither.  The
waves dashed high, the wind drove the ships helplessly before it,
and the Archangel, which bore the Governor was separated from the
others, and driven far out of its course.  Thus it happened that
Ingoldsby, the Lieutenant-Governor, arrived in New York without the
Governor.  However he sent to Leisler asking him to allow the soldiers
he had brought to enter the fort.  This request made Leisler very
angry.  He refused to allow the soldiers to enter the fort unless
Ingoldsby showed him orders in writing either from the King or
Governor.</p></div> </div>
