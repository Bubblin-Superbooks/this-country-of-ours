of conquering the Americans.  But as Pitt had told them again and
again, it was an impossible task.  At length, having failed to make
any impression in the north they decided to change the seat of war
and attack the weaker colonies in the south.</p><p>Here for a time they were more successful.  Georgia was overrun,
then South Carolina, and Charleston, which had made such a brave
defence at the beginning of the war, surrendered to the British,
with all its stores of food and ammunition.</p><p>Things were going badly for the patriots in the south, and Gates,
who was still looked upon as a hero, because Burgoyne had surrendered
to him, was sent to take command.  Now he had a chance to prove of
what stuff he was made.  He proved it by being utterly defeated at
the battle of Camden.</p></div> </div>
