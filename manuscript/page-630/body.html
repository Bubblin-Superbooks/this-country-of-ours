<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The New Englanders had been greatly delighted at their conquest
of Louisburg.  The French, on the other hand, were greatly grieved,
and when terms of peace were discussed Louis XV insisted that
Louisburg should be restored. "That cannot be," said King George.
"It is not mine to give, for it was taken by the people of Boston."</p><p>The French, however, were firm.  So King George gave way, and Louisburg
was restored to France, and Madras in India, which the French had
taken, was in exchange restored to Britain.  When the New Englanders
heard of it, they were very angry.  Madras was nothing to them; it
was but a "petty factory" on the other side of the globe; while
Louisburg was at their very doors, and of vast importance to their
security.  They had to obey and give it back.  But they did so with
bitterness in their hearts against a King who cared so little for
their welfare.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
