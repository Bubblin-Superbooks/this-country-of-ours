reality there was great religious freedom in Maryland, and for a
time it was there only that Catholics found freedom in America.</p><p>But in order to secure toleration for the Catholic religion Lord
Baltimore found himself obliged to tolerate all others.  So men of
all creeds came to settle in Maryland and find freedom.</p><p>The people of Virginia were very far from pleased when they heard
of the new colony about to be planted so near them.  For part of the
land which had been given to Lord Baltimore they claimed as their
own, and they looked upon the newcomers as intruders on their
territory and resolved to maintain their rights.  They did all they
could to prevent the new settlers coming.  Nevertheless, in spite
of everything, Leonard Calvert set sail with his colonists, many
of whom were well-to-do people, in two ships called the Ark and
the Dove.</p></div> </div>
