<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Smith.  Joseph Smith
was a shiftless, idle, jovial fellow, one of a large family as
shiftless and idle as himself.  He was very ignorant, but he had a
wonderful imagination, and he could never tell the simplest happening
of his everyday life without making a great story out of it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When he grew to be a man he began to dream dreams and see visions,
and at length he declared that a messenger from heaven had shown
him where to find a golden book.  No one else saw this golden book,
because Smith had been warned by the angel that great punishment
would fall upon him if he showed it to any one.  He was, however,
allowed to make a "translation" of what was written in the book.
This he did, publishing it as "The Book of the Mormons" or "The
Golden Bible." But it seems very likely that part of this so-called
translation was really copied from a story written by a man named
Spaulding which had never been published.  A great deal of it was,
however, copied</p></div> </div>
