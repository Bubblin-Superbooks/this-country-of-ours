navy, and indeed they had need of success somewhere to keep up their

was commander-in-chief, and although he drilled his army splendidly
he never did anything with it.  He was a wonderful organiser, but
he was cautious to a fault, and always believed the enemy to be
far stronger than he really was.</p></div> </div>
