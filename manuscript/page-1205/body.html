her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and
happiness, and the peace which she has treasured.  God helping her
she can do no other."</p><p>In these noble words the President of the United States threw down
the gauge of battle.  There was in his heart no rancour against
the German people, but only a righteous wrath against her criminal
rulers who for their own selfish ends had plunged the world in
misery.  Never in the world's history has a great nation gone to
war in so chivalrous a spirit, for so unselfish ends.</p><p>"We have no selfish ends to serve," said the President. "We desire
no conquest, no dominion.  We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no
material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make.  We
are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind.  We shall be
satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith
and the freedom of nations can make them."</p></div> </div>
