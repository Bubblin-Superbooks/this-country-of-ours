while from division to division rode Grant cheering them, directing
them, urging them to greater and ever greater efforts.</p><p>Some of the fiercest fighting raged round the little log meeting
house called Shiloh, and from this meeting house the battle takes

ringing voice cheered on his men.  Then suddenly the voice grew faint,
the tall figure bent, and a deathly whiteness overspread his cheeks.</p></div> </div>
