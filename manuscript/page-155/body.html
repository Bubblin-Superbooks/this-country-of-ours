back laden with banners, arms and armour.  Then guarded by Spanish
soldiers the Frenchmen were brought across by tons.  As each batch
landed they found themselves prisoners; their arms were taken from
them and their hands were tied behind their backs.</p><p>All day, hour after hour, the boat plied to and fro: and when all
the Frenchmen had been brought over they were ordered to march
forward.  The Spanish general walked in front.  But he did not go
far, for the sun was already setting, and it was time to camp for
the night.  So but a little way from the shore he stopped, and drew
a line in the sand.  And when the wretched Frenchmen reached that
line, weaponless and helpless as they were, they were one and all
put to death.  Then, glorying in his deed, Menendez returned to St.
Augustine.</p></div> </div>
