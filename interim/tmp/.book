He was a man mighty in war, and men held him in high honour.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now one day to the court of Eric there came Bjarni the son of\nHeriulf.  This Bjarni was a far traveler.  He had sailed many times\nupon the seas, and when he came home he had ever some fresh tale\nof marvel and</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">adventure to tell.  But this time he had a tale to\ntell more marvelous than any before.  For he told how far away across\nthe sea of Greenland, where no man had sailed before, he had found\na new, strange land.</p><p>But when the people asked news of this unknown land Bjarni could\ntell them little, for he had not set foot upon those far shores.\nTherefore the people scorned him.</p><p>\"Truly you have little hardihood,\" they said, \"else you had gone\nashore, and seen for yourself, and had given us good account of\nthis land.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But although Bjarni could tell nought of the new strange land, save\nthat he had seen it, the people thought much about it, and there\nwas great talk about voyages and discoveries, and many longed to\nsail forth and find again the land which Bjarni the Traveler had\nseen.  But more than any other in that kingdom, Leif the son of Eric\nthe Red, longed to find that land.  So Leif</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">went to Eric and said:</p><p>\"Oh my father, I fain would seek the land which Bjarni the Traveler\nhas seen.  Give me gold that I may buy his ship and sail away upon\nthe seas to find it.\"</p><p>Then Eric the Red gave his son gold in great plenty. \"Go, my son,\"\nhe said, \"buy the ship of Bjarni the Traveler, and sail to the land\nof which he tells.\"</p><p>Then Leif, quickly taking the gold, went to Bjarni and bought his\nship.</p><p>Leif was a tall man, of great strength and noble bearing.  He was\nalso a man of wisdom, and just in all things, so that men loved\nand were ready to obey him.</p><p>Now therefore many men came to him offering to be his companions\nin adventure, until soon they were a company of thirty-five men.\nThey were all men tall and of great strength, with fair golden hair\nand eyes blue as the sea upon which they loved to sail, save only\nTyrker the German.</p>",
  "page-13": "<p>Long time this German had lived with Eric the Red and was much\nbeloved by him.  Tyrker also loved Leif dearly, for he had known\nhim since he was a child, and was indeed his foster father.  So he\nwas eager to go with Leif upon this adventurous voyage.  Tyrker was\nvery little and plain.  His forehead was high and his eyes small and\nrestless.  He wore shabby clothes, and to the blue-eyed, fair-haired\ngiants of the North he seemed indeed a sorry-looking little fellow.\nBut all that mattered little, for he was a clever craftsman, and\nLeif and his companions were glad to have him go with them.</p><p>Then, all things being ready, Leif went to his father and, bending\nhis knee to him, prayed him to be their leader.</p><p>But Eric the Red shook his head. \"Nay, my son,\" he said, \" I am old\nand stricken in years, and no more able to endure the hardships of\nthe sea.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Yet come, my father,\" pleaded Leif, \"for of a</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">certainty if you\ndo, good luck will go with us.\"</p><p>Then Eric looked longingly at the sea.  His heart bade him go out\nupon it once again ere he died.  So he yielded to the prayers of\nhis son and, mounting upon his horse, he rode towards the ship.</p><p>When the sea-farers saw him come they set up a shout of welcome.\nBut when Eric was not far from the ship the horse upon which he\nwas riding stumbled, and he was thrown to the ground.  He tried to\nrise but could not, for his foot was sorely wounded.</p><p>Seeing that he cried out sadly, \"It is not for me to discover new\nlands; go ye without me.\"</p><p>So Eric the Red returned to his home, and Leif went on his way to\nhis ship with his companions.</p><p>Now they busied themselves and set their dragon-headed vessel\nin order.  And when all was ready they spread their gaily-coloured\nsails, and sailed out into the unknown sea.</p>",
  "page-15": "<p>Westward and ever westward they sailed towards the setting of the\nsun.  For many days they sailed yet they saw no land: nought was\nabout them but the restless, tossing waves.  But at length one day\nto their watching eyes there appeared a faint grey line far on the\nhorizon.  Then their hearts bounded for joy.  They had not sailed in\nvain, for land was near.</p><p>\"Surely,\" said Leif, as they drew close to it, \"this is the land\nwhich Bjarni saw.  Let it not be said of us that we passed it by as\nhe did.\"</p><p>So, casting anchor, Leif and his companions launched a boat and\nwent ashore.  But it was no fair land to which they had come.  Far\ninland great snow-covered mountains rose, and between them and the\nsea lay flat and barren rock, where no grass or green thing grew.\nIt seemed to Leif and his companions that there was no good thing\nin this land.</p><p>\"I will call it Helluland or Stone Land,\" said Leif.</p>",
  "page-16": "<p>Then he and his companions went back to the ship and put out to\nsea once more.  They came to land again after some time, and again\nthey cast anchor and launched a boat and went ashore.  This land\nwas flat.  Broad stretches of white sand sloped gently to the sea,\nand behind the level plain was thickly wooded.</p><p>\"This land,\" said Leif, \"shall also have a name after its nature.\"\nSo he called it Markland or Woodland.</p><p>Then again Leif and his companions returned to the ship, and mounting\ninto it they sailed away upon the sea.  And now fierce winds arose,\nand the ship was driven before the blast so that for days these\nseafarers thought no more of finding new lands, but only of the\nsafety of their ship.</p><p>But at length the wind fell, and the sun shone forth once more.  Then\nagain they saw land, and launching their boat they rowed ashore.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To the eyes of these sea-faring men, who for many</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">days had seen\nonly the wild waste of waters, the land seemed passing fair.  For\nthe grass was green, and as the sun shone upon it seemed to sparkle\nwith a thousand diamonds.  When the men put their hands upon the\ngrass, and touched their mouths with their hands, and drank the\ndew, it seemed to them that never before had they tasted anything\nso sweet.  So pleasant the land seemed to Leif and his companions\nthat they determined to pass the winter there.  They therefore drew\ntheir ship up the river which flowed into the sea, and cast anchor.</p><p>Then they carried their hammocks ashore and set to work to build\na house</p><p>When the house was finished Leif called his companions together\nand spoke to them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I will now divide our company into two bands,\" he said, \"so that\nwe may explore the country round about.  One half shall stay at\nhome, and the other half shall</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">explore the land.  But they who go\nto explore must not go so far away that they cannot return home at\nnight, nor must they separate from each other, lest they be lost.\"</p><p>And as Leif said so it was done.  Each day a company set out\nto explore, and sometimes Leif went with the exploring party, and\nsometimes he stayed at home.  But each day as evening came they all\nreturned to their house, and told what they had seen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length, however, one day, when those who had gone abroad returned,\none of their number was missing, and when the roll was called it\nwas found that it was Tyrker the German who had strayed.  Thereat\nLeif was sorely troubled, for he loved his foster-father dearly.  So\nhe spoke sternly to his men, reproaching them for their carelessness\nin letting Tyrker separate from them, and taking twelve of his men\nwith him he set out at once to search for his foster-father.  But\nthey had not gone far</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">when, to their great joy, they saw their lost\ncomrade coming towards them.</p><p>\"Why art thou so late, oh my foster-father?\" cried Leif, as he ran\nto him.  \"Why hast thou gone astray from the others?\"</p><p>But Tyrker paid little heed to Leif's questions.  He was strangely\nexcited, and rolling his eyes wildly he laughed and spoke in German\nwhich no one understood.  At length, however, he grew calmer and\nspoke to them in their own language. \"I did not go much farther\nthan the others,\" he said. \"But I have found something new.  I have\nfound vines and grapes.\"</p><p>\"Is that indeed true, my foster-father?\" said Leif.</p><p>\"Of a certainty it is true,\" replied Tyrker. \"For I was born where\nvines grow freely.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This was great news; and all the men were eager to go and see\nfor themselves the vines which Tyrker had discovered.  But it was\nalready late, so they all returned</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to the house, and waited with\nwhat patience they could until morning.</p><p>Then, as soon as it was day, Tyrker led his companions to the place\nwhere he had found the grapes.  And when Leif saw them he called\nthe land Vineland because of them.  He also decided to load his\nship with grapes and wood, and depart homeward.  So each day the\nmen gathered grapes and felled trees, until the ship was full.  Then\nthey set sail for home.</p><p>The winds were fair, and with but few adventures they arrived safely\nat home.  There they were received with great rejoicing.  Henceforth\nLeif was called Leif the Lucky, and he lived ever after in great\nhonour and plenty, and the land which he had discovered men called\nVineland the Good.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In due time, however, Eric the Red died, and after that Leif the\nLucky sailed no more upon the seas, for his father's kingdom was now\nhis, and he must needs stay at</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">home to rule his land.  But Leif's\nbrother Thorvald greatly desired to go to Vineland so that he might\nexplore the country still further.</p><p>Then when Leif saw his brother's desire he said to him, \"If it be\nthy will, brother, thou mayest go to Vineland in my ship.\"</p><p>At that Thorvald rejoiced greatly, and gathering thirty men he\nset sail, crossed the sea without adventure, and came to the place\nwhere Leif had built his house.</p><p>There he and his company remained during the winter.  Then in the\nspring they set forth to explore the coast.  After some time they\ncame upon a fair country where there were many trees.</p><p>When Thorvald saw it he said, \"It is so fair a country that I should\nlike to make my home here.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Until this time the Norsemen had seen no inhabitants of the land.\nBut now as they returned to their ship they saw three mounds upon\nthe shore. </p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">When the Norsemen came near they saw that these three\nmounds were three canoes, and under each were three men armed with\nbows and arrows, who lay in wait to slay them.  When the Norsemen\nsaw that, they divided their company and put themselves in battle\narray.  And after a fierce battle they slew the savages, save one\nwho fled to his canoe and so escaped.</p><p>When the fight was over the Norsemen climbed upon a, high headland\nand looked round to see if there were signs of any more savages.\nBelow them they saw several mounds which they took to be the houses\nof the savages, and knew that it behooved them therefore to be on\ntheir guard.  But they were too weary to go further, and casting\nthemselves down upon the ground where they were they fell into a\nheavy sleep.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Suddenly they were awakened by a great shout, and they seemed to\nhear a voice cry aloud, \"Awake, Thorvald, thou and all thy company,\nif ye would save</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">your lives.  Flee to thy ship with all thy men,\nand sail with speed from this land.\"</p><p>So Thorvald and his companions fled speedily to their ship, and\nset it in fighting array.  Soon a crowd of dark-skinned savages,\nuttering fearful yells, rushed upon them.  They cast their arrows\nat the Norsemen, and fought fiercely for some time.  But seeing that\ntheir arrows availed little against the strangers, and that on the\nother hand many of their braves were slain, they at last fled.</p><p>Then, the enemy being fled, Thorvald, turning to his men, asked,\n\"Are any of you wounded?\"</p><p>\"Nay,\" they answered, \"we are all whole.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"That is well, \" said Thorvald. \"As for me, I am wounded in the\narmpit by an arrow.  Here is the shaft.  Of a surety it will cause\nmy death.  And now I counsel you, turn homeward with all speed.  But\ncarry me first to that headland which seemed to me to promise</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">so\npleasant a dwelling-place, and lay me there.  Thus it shall be seen\nthat I spoke truth when I wished to abide there.  And ye shall place\na cross at my feet, and another at my head, and call it Cross Ness\never after.\"</p><p>So Thorvald died.  Then his companions buried him as he had bidden\nthem in the land which had seemed to him so fair.  And as he had\ncommanded they set a cross at his feet and another at his head, and\ncalled the place Cross Ness.  Thus the first white man was laid to\nrest in Vineland the Good.</p><p>Then when spring came the Norsemen sailed home to Greenland.  And\nthere they told Leif of all the things they had seen and done, and\nhow his brave brother had met his death.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now when Leif's brother Thorstein heard how Thorvald had died he\nlonged to sail to Vineland to bring home his brother's body.  So once\nagain Leif's ship was made ready, and with five and twenty tall,\nstrong</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">men Thorstein set forth, taking with him his wife Gudrid.</p><p>But Thorstein never saw Vineland the Good.  For storms beset his\nship, and after being driven hither and thither for many months,\nhe lost all reckoning, and at last came to land in Greenland once\nmore.  And there Thorstein died, and Gudrid went home to Leif.</p><p>Now there came to Greenland that summer a man of great wealth named\nThorfinn.  And when he saw Gudrid he loved her and sought her in\nmarriage, and Leif giving his consent to it, Thorfinn and Gudrid\nwere married.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At this time many people still talked of the voyages to Vineland,\nand they urged Thorfinn to journey thither and seek to find out\nmore about these strange lands.  And more than all the others Gudrid\nurged him to go.  So at length Thorfinn determined to undertake\nthe voyage.  But it came to his mind that he would not</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">merely go to\nVineland and return home again.  He resolved rather to settle there\nand make it his home.</p><p>Thorfinn therefore gathered about sixty men, and those who had\nwives took also their wives with them, together with their cattle\nand their household goods.</p><p>Then Thorfinn asked Leif to give him the house which he had built\nin Vineland.  And Leif replied, \"I will lend the house to you, but\nI will not give it.\"</p><p>So Thorfinn and Gudrid and all their company sailed out to sea,\nand without adventures arrived safely at Leif's house in Vineland.</p><p>There they lived all that winter in great comfort.  There was no lack\nof food either for man or beast, and the cattle they had brought\nwith them roamed at will, and fed upon the wide prairie lands.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All winter and spring the Norsemen dwelt in Vineland, and they saw\nno human beings save themselves.  Then one day in early summer they\nsaw a</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">great troop of natives come out of the wood.  They were dark\nand little, and it seemed to the Norsemen very ugly, with great\neyes and broad cheeks.  The cattle were near, and as the savages\nappeared the bull began to bellow.  And when the savages heard that\nsound they were afraid and fled.  For three whole weeks nothing more\nwas seen of them, after that time however they took courage again\nand returned.  As they approached they made signs to show that they\ncame in peace, and with them they brought huge bales of furs which\nthey wished to barter.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Norsemen, it is true, could not understand the language of\nthe natives, nor could the natives understand the Norsemen; but by\nsigns they made known that they wished to barter their furs for\nweapons.  This, however, Thorfinn forbade.  Instead he gave them\nstrips of red cloth which they took very eagerly and bound about\ntheir heads.  Thorfinn also</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">commanded his men to take milk to the\nsavages.  And when they saw it they were eager to buy and drink it.\nSo that it was said many of them carried away their merchandise in\ntheir stomachs.</p><p>Thus the days and months passed.  Then one summer day a little son\nwas born to Thorfinn and Gudrid.  They called him Snorri, and he\nwas the first white child to be born on the Continent which later\nmen called the New World.  Thus three years went past.  But the days\nwere not all peaceful.  For quarrels arose between the newcomers\nand the natives, and the savages attacked the Norsemen and killed\nmany of them.</p><p>Then Thorfinn said he would no longer stay in Vineland, but would\nreturn to Greenland.  So he and all his company made ready their\nship, and sailed out upon the seas, and came at length safely to\nGreenland.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then after a time Thorfinn sailed to Iceland.  There he made his home\nfor the rest of his life, the people</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">holding him in high honour.\nSnorri also, his son who had been born in Vineland, grew to be a\nman of great renown.</p><p>Such are some of the old Norse stories of the first finding of\nAmerica.  The country which Leif called Helluland was most likely\nLabrador, Markland Newfoundland, and Vineland Nova Scotia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Besides these there were many other tales of voyages to Vineland.\nFor after Leif and his brothers many other Vikings of the North\nsailed, both from Greenland and from Norway, to the fair western\nlands.  Yet although they sailed there so often these old Norsemen\nhad no idea that they had discovered a vast continent.  They thought\nthat Vineland was merely an island, and the discovery of it made\nno stir in Europe.  By degrees too the voyages thither ceased.  In\ndays of wild warfare at home the Norsemen forgot the fair western\nland which Leif had discovered.  They heard of it only in</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">minstrel\ntales, and it came to be for them a sort of fairy-land which had\nno existence save in a poet's dream.</p><p>But now wise men have read these tales with care, and many have\ncome to believe that they are not mere fairy stories.  They have\ncome to believe that hundreds of years before Columbus lived the\nVikings of the North sailed the western seas and found the land\nwhich lay beyond, the land which we now call America.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-31": "<h4>Chapter 2</h4><h3>The Sea Of Darkness And The Great Faith Of Columbus</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">In those far-off times besides the Vikings of the North other\ndaring sailors sailed the seas.  But all their sailings took them\neastward.  For it was from the east that all the trade and the riches\ncame in those days.  To India and to far Cathay sailed the merchant\nthrough the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, to return with a rich\nand fragrant cargo of silks and spices, pearls and</p>",
  "page-32": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">priceless gems.</p><p>None thought of sailing westward.  For to men of those days the\nAtlantic Ocean was known as the Outer Sea or the Sea of Darkness.\nThere was nothing to be gained by venturing upon it, much to be\ndreaded.  It was said that huge and horrible sea-dragons lived there,\nready to wreck and swallow down any vessel that might venture near.\nAn enormous bird also hovered in the skies waiting to pounce upon\nvessels and bear them away to some unknown eyrie.  Even if any\nfoolhardy adventurers should defy these dangers, and escape the\nhorror of the dragons and the bird, other perils threatened them.\nFor far in the west there lay a bottomless pit of seething fire.\nThat was easy of proof.  Did not the face of the setting sun glow\nwith the reflected light as it sank in the west? There would be no\nhope nor rescue for any ship that should be drawn into that awful\npit.</p>",
  "page-33": "<p>Again it was believed that the ocean flowed downhill, and that if a\nship sailed down too far it would never be able to get back again.\nThese and many other dangers, said the ignorant people of those\ndays, threatened the rash sailors who should attempt to sail upon\nthe Sea of Darkness.  So it was not wonderful that for hundreds of\nyears men contented themselves with the well-known routes which\nindeed offered adventure enough to satisfy the heart of the most\ndaring.</p><p>But as time passed these old trade-routes fell more and more into\nthe hands of Turks and Infidels.  Port after port came under their\nrule, and infidel pirates swarmed in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean\nuntil no Christian vessel was safe.  At every step Christian traders\nfound themselves hampered and hindered, and in danger of their\nlives, and they began to long for another way to the lands of spice\nand pearls.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then it was that men turned their thoughts to the</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dread Sea of\nDarkness.  The less ignorant among them had begun to disbelieve the\ntales of dragons and fiery pits.  The world was round, said wise\nmen.  Why then, if that were so, India could be reached by sailing\nwest as well as by sailing east.</p><p>Many men now came to this conclusion, among them an Italian sailor\nnamed Christopher Columbus.  The more Columbus thought about his\nplan of sailing west to reach India, the more he believed in it,\nand the more he longed to set out.  But without a great deal of money\nsuch an expedition was impossible, and Columbus was poor.  His only\nhope was to win the help and friendship of a king or some other\ngreat and wealthy person.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Portuguese were in those days a sea-faring people, and their\nships were to be found wherever ships dared go.  Indeed Prince Henry\nof Portugal did so much to encourage voyages of discovery that he\nwas called</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Henry the Navigator.  And although he was by this time\ndead, the people still took great interest in voyages of discovery.\nSo at length Columbus determined to go to King John of Portugal to\ntell him of his plans, and ask for his aid.</p><p>King John listened kindly enough, it seemed, to what Columbus had\nto say.  But before giving him any answer he said that he must\nconsult his wise men.  These wise men looked upon the whole idea\nof sailing to the west to reach the east as absurd.  So King John\nrefused to give Columbus any help.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yet although most of King John's wise men thought little of the\nplan, King John himself thought that there was something in it.\nBut instead of helping Columbus he meanly resolved to send out\nan expedition of his own.  This he did, and when Columbus heard of\nit he was so angry that he left Portugal, which for more than ten\nyears he had made his home.  He was poor and in</p>",
  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">debt, so he left\nthe country secretly, in fear of the King, and of those to whom he\nowed money.</p><p>When Columbus thus fled from Portugal, penniless and in debt, he\nwas a man over forty.  He was a bitterly disappointed man, too, but\nhe still clung to his great idea.  So he sent his brother Bartholomew\nto England to beg King Henry VII to help him, while he himself\nturned towards Spain.  Bartholomew, however, reached England in an\nevil hour for his quest.  For Henry VII had but newly wrested the\ncrown from Richard III, and so had no thought to spare for unknown\nlands.  Christopher also arrived in Spain at an unfortunate time.\nFor the Spaniards were carrying on a fierce warfare against the\nMoors, and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had little thought\nor money to spare for any other undertaking.  Therefore, although\nFerdinand listened to what Columbus had to say, for the time being\nhe could promise no help.</p>",
  "page-37": "<p>So years passed.  Columbus remained in Spain.  For in spite of all\nhis rebuffs and disappointments he did not despair.  As the court\nmoved from place to place he followed it, hoping always that the\nday would come when the King and Queen would listen to him, and\nbelieve in his great enterprise.</p><p>Meanwhile he lived in want and misery, and just kept himself from\nstarvation by making and selling maps.  To the common people he\nseemed a madman, and as he passed through the streets in his worn\nand threadbare garments children jeered and pointed fingers of\nscorn at him.</p><p>Yet in spite of mockery and derision Columbus clung to his faith.\nIndeed it burned in him so strongly that at length he made others\nshare it too, and men who were powerful at court became his friends.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At last the war with the Moors ended victoriously for Spain.  Then\nthese friends persuaded Queen Isabella</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to listen again to what\nColumbus had to say.  To this the Queen consented, and when she\nheard how poor Columbus was she sent him some money, so that he\nmight buy clothes fit to appear at court.</p><p>When Columbus heard the good news he was overjoyed.  As quickly as\nmight be he bought new clothes, and mounting upon a mule he rode\ntowards Granada.  But when Columbus arrived he found the court\nstill in the midst of rejoicings to celebrate victory.  Among\nthe light-hearted, gaily dressed throng there was no one who had\na thought to spare for the melancholy, white-haired dreamer who\npassed like a dark shadow amidst them.  With his fate, as it were,\ntrembling in the balance, Columbus had no heart for rejoicing.  So\nhe looked on \"with indifference, almost with contempt.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But at length his day came.  At length all the jubilation was over,\nand Ferdinand and Isabella turned their thoughts to Columbus.  He\ncame before them and</p>",
  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">talked so earnestly of his great project that\nthey could not but believe in it.  The day was won.  Both King and\nQueen, but more especially the Queen, were willing to help the\ngreat enterprise.  Now however Columbus himself all but wrecked\nhis chances.  He had dreamed so long about this splendid adventure,\nhe was so filled with belief in its grandeur, that he demanded\nconditions such as would hardly have been granted to the greatest\nprince in the land.</p><p>Columbus demanded that he should be made admiral and viceroy of all\nthe lands he might discover, and that after his death this honour\nshould descend to his son and to his son's son for ever and ever.\nHe also demanded a tenth part of all the pearls, precious stones,\ngold, silver and spices, or whatever else he might gain by trade\nor barter.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At these demands the grandees of Spain stood aghast.  What! This\nshabby dreamer, this penniless</p>",
  "page-40": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">beggar aspired to honour and dignities\nfit for a prince! It was absurd, and not to be thought of.  If this\nbeggarly sailor would have Spain assist him he must needs be more\nhumble in suit.</p><p>But not one jot would Columbus abate of his demands.  So the Council\nbroke up, and Columbus, with anger and disappointment in his heart,\nmounted his mule and turned his face towards the Court of France.\nAll the seven long years during which he had waited, and hoped,\nand prayed, in Spain had been wasted.  Now he would go to the King\nof France, and make his last appeal there.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But Columbus had left friends behind him, friends who had begun\nto picture to themselves almost as vividly as he the splendours of\nthe conquest he was to make.  Now these friends sought out the Queen.\nIn glowing words they painted to her the glory and the honour which\nwould come to Spain if Columbus</p>",
  "page-41": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">succeeded.  And if he failed, why,\nwhat were a few thousand crowns, they asked.  And as the Queen\nlistened her heart beat fast; the magnificence of the enterprise\ntook hold upon her, and she resolved that, come what might, Columbus\nshould go forth on his adventure.</p><p>Ferdinand, however, still looked coldly on.  The war against the\nMoors had been long and bitter, his treasury was empty.  Whence, he\nasked himself, was money forthcoming for this mad scheme? Isabella,\nhowever, had done with prudence and caution. \"If there is not money\nenough in Aragon,\" she cried, \"I will undertake this adventure for\nmy own kingdom of Castile, and if need be I will pawn my jewels to\ndo it.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">While these things were happening Columbus, sick at heart, was\nslowly plodding on the road to France.  But he only went a little\nway on his long journey.  For just as he was entering a narrow pass\nnot far from Granada,</p>",
  "page-42": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">where the mountains towered above him, he\nheard the thud of horses' hoofs.</p><p>It was a lonely and silent spot among the hills, where robbers\nlurked, and where many a man had been slain for the money and jewels\nhe carried.  Columbus, however, had nothing to dread: he carried\nwith him neither gold nor jewels.  He went forth from Spain a beggar,\neven as he had come.  But if fear he had any, it was soon turned to\nincredulous joy.  For when the horsemen came up they told Columbus\nthat his friends had won the day for him, and that he must return.</p><p>At first Columbus hesitated.  He found it hard to believe that truly\nat last he had his heart's desire.  When, however, the messenger\ntold him that the Queen herself bade him return, he hesitated no\nlonger.  Joyfully turning his mule he hastened back to Granada.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At last Columbus had won his heart's desire, and he had only to gather\nships and men and set forth</p>",
  "page-43": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">westward.  But now a new difficulty\narose.  For it was out upon the terrible Sea of Darkness that Columbus\nwished to sail, and men feared to face its terrors.</p><p>Week after week went past and not a ship or a man could Columbus\nget.  He persuaded and implored in vain: no man was brave enough to\nfollow him to the unknown horrors of the Sea of Darkness.  Therefore\nas entreaty and persuasion proved of no avail, Columbus sought help\nfrom the King, who gave him power to force men to go with him.</p><p>Even then all sorts of difficulties were thrown in the way.\nColumbus, however, overcame them all, and at length his three ships\nwere ready.  But it had taken many months.  It was February when he\nturned back so gladly to Granada; it was the third of August before\neverything was in order.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Before dawn upon the day he sailed Columbus entered the church, in\nthe little sea-faring town of Palos</p>",
  "page-44": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">where his ships lay at anchor.\nThere he humbly confessed his sins, received the Sacrament, and\ncommitted himself to God's all-powerful guidance.  The crew, wild,\nrough fellows, many of them, followed his example.  Then Columbus\nstepped on board his ship, the Santa Maria, and turned his face\nwestward.</p><p>He was filled with exaltation.  But all Palos was filled with gloom,\nand upon the shore a great crowd gathered to bid a last farewell\nto these daring adventurers.  And as the ships spread their sails\nand sped forth in the morning light the people wept and lamented\nsorely, for they never thought again to see their loved ones, who\nwere about to adventure forth upon the terrible Sea of Darkness.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

And when the men saw the last trace of land</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">vanish their\nhearts sank, and they shed bitter tears, weeping for home and the\nloved ones they thought never more to see.</p><p>On and on they sailed, and as day after day no land appeared the\nmen grew restless.  Seeing them thus restless, and lest they should\nbe utterly terrified at being so far from home upon this seemingly\nendless waste of waters, Columbus determined to keep them from\nknowing how far they had really gone.  So he kept two reckonings.\nOne, in which the real length of the ships' daily journey was given\nhe kept to himself: the other, in which the journey was given as\nmuch shorter, he showed to the sailors.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A month went past, six weeks went past, and still there was no\ntrace of land.  Then at length came signs.  Snow birds which never\nventured far to sea flew round the ships.  Now the waves bore to\nthem a rudely carved stick, now the ships ploughed a way through\nmasses of</p>",
  "page-47": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">floating weeds.  All these signs were at first greeted\nwith joy and hope, and the sailors took heart.  But as still the\ndays went past and no land appeared, they lost heart again.</p><p>The fields of weeds which they had at first greeted with joy now\nbecame an added terror.  Would they not be caught in this tangle\nof weeds, they asked, and never more win a way out of it? To their\nfearful and superstitious minds the very breeze which had borne\nthem softly onward became a menace.  For if the wind always blew\nsteadily from the east how was it possible ever to return to Spain? So\nColumbus was almost glad when a contrary wind blew.  For it proved\nto his trembling sailors that one at least of their fears was\ngroundless.  But it made little difference.  The men were now utterly\ngiven over to gloomy terrors.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Fear robbed them of all ambition.  Ferdinand and Isabella had\npromised a large sum of money to the man</p>",
  "page-48": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">who should first discover\nland.  But none cared now to win it.  All they desired was to turn\nhome once more.</p><p>Fear made them mutinous also.  So they whispered together and planned\nin secret to rid themselves of Columbus.  It would be easy, they\nthought, to throw him overboard some dark night, and then give out\nthat he had fallen into the sea by accident.  No one would know.  No\none in Spain would care, for Columbus was after all but a foreigner\nand an upstart.  The great ocean would keep the secret.  They would\nbe free to turn homeward.</p><p>Columbus saw their dark looks, heard the murmurs of the crews, and\ndid his best to hearten them again.  He spoke to them cheerfully,\npersuading and encouraging, \"laughing at them, while in his heart\nhe wept.\"</p><p>Still the men went sullenly about their work.  But at length one\nmorning a sudden cry from the Pinta shook them from out their sullen\nthoughts.</p>",
  "page-49": "<p>It was the captain of the Pinta who shouted. \"Land, land, my lord!\"\nhe cried. \"I claim the reward.\"</p><p>And when Columbus heard that shout his heart was filled with joy\nand thankfulness, and baring his head he sank upon his knees, giving\npraise to God.  The crew followed his example.  Then, their hearts\nsuddenly light and joyous, they swarmed up the masts and into the\nrigging to feast their eyes upon the goodly sight.</p><p>All day they sailed onward toward the promised land.  The sun sank\nand still all night the ships sped on their joyous way.  But when\nmorning dawned the land seemed no nearer than before.  Hope died\naway again, and sorrowfully as the day went on the woeful truth\nthat the fancied land had been but a bank of clouds was forced upon\nColumbus.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Again for days the ships sailed on, and as still no land appeared\nthe men again began to murmur.  Then one day when Columbus walked\non deck he was met, not</p>",
  "page-50": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">merely with sullen looks, but with angry\nwords.  The men clamoured to return.  And if the Admiral refused,\nwhy, so much the worse for him.  They would endure no longer.</p><p>Bravely the Admiral faced the mutineers.  He talked to them cheerfully.\nHe reminded them of what honour and gain would be theirs when they\nreturned home having found the new way to India, of what wealth\nthey might win by trading.  Then he ended sternly:</p><p>\"Complain how you may,\" he said, \"I have to go to the Indies, and\nI will go on till I find them, so help me God.\"</p><p>For the time being the Admiral's stern, brave words cowed\nthe mutineers.  But not for much longer, Columbus knew right well,\nwould they obey him if land did not soon appear.  And in his heart\nhe prayed God that it might not be long delayed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The next night Columbus stood alone upon the</p>",
  "page-51": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">poop of the Santa\nMaria.  Full of anxious thoughts he gazed out into the darkness.\nThen suddenly it seemed to him that far in the distance he saw a\nglimmering light appear and disappear once and again.  It was as if\nsome one walking carried a light.  But so fearful was Columbus lest\nhis fervent hopes had caused him to imagine this light that he would\nnot trust his own eyes alone.  So he called to one of his officers\nand asked him if he saw any light.</p><p>\"Yes,\" replied the officer, \"I see a light.\"</p><p>Then Columbus called a second man.  He could not at first see the\nlight, and in any case neither of them thought much of it.  Columbus,\nhowever, made sure that land was close, and calling the men about\nhim he bade them keep a sharp look-out, promising a silken doublet\nto the man who should first see land.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So till two o'clock in the morning the ships held on their way.  Then\nfrom the Pinta there came again a</p>",
  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">joyful shout of \"Land!  Land!\"</p><p>This time it proved no vision, it was land indeed; and at last the\nlong-looked-for goal was reached.  The land proved to be an island\ncovered with beautiful trees, and as they neared the shore the men\nsaw naked savages crowding to the beach.</p><p>In awed wonder these savages watched the huge white birds, as the\nships with their great sails seemed to them.  Nearer and nearer\nthey came, and when they reached the shore and folded their wings\nthe natives fled in terror to the shelter of the forest.

Then, each at the head of his own ship's crew,\ncame the captains of the</p>",
  "page-53": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Pinta and the Nina, each carrying in his\nhand a white banner with a green cross and the crowned initials\nof the King and Queen, which was the special banner devised for\nthe great adventure.  Every man was dressed in his best, and the\ngay-coloured clothes, the shining armour, and fluttering banners\nmade a gorgeous pageant.  Upon it the sun shone in splendour and the\nblue sky was reflected in a bluer sea: while scarlet flamingoes,\nstartled at the approach of the white men, rose in brilliant flight.</p><p>As Columbus landed he fell upon his knees and kissed the ground,\nand with tears of joy running down his cheeks he gave thanks to\nGod, the whole company following his example.

  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">into shouts of\ntriumph and joy.  They crowded round Columbus, kneeling before him\nto kiss his hands and feet praying forgiveness for their insolence\nand mutiny, and promising in the future to obey him without question.\nFor Columbus it was a moment of pure joy and triumph.  All his long\nyears of struggle and waiting had come to a glorious end.</p><p>Yet he knew already that his search was not finished, his triumph\nnot yet complete.  He had not reached the eastern shores of India,\nthe land of spice and pearls.  He had not even reached Cipango, the\nrich and golden isle.  But he had at least, he thought, found some\noutlying island off the coast of India, and that India itself could\nnot be far away.  He never discovered his mistake, so the group of\nislands nowhere near India, but lying between the two great Continents\nof America, are known as the West Indies.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Columbus called the island upon which he first</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">landed San Salvador,\nand for a long time it was thought to be the island which is still\ncalled San Salvador or Cat Island.  But lately people have come to\nbelieve that Columbus first landed upon an island a little further\nsouth, now called, Watling Island.</p><p>From San Salvador Columbus sailed about and landed upon several\nother islands, naming them and taking possession of them for Spain.\nHe saw many strange and beautiful fruits: \"trees of a thousand\nsorts, straight and tall enough to make masts for the largest ships\nof Spain.\" He saw flocks of gaily coloured parrots and many other\nbirds that sang most sweetly.  He saw fair harbours so safe and\nspacious that he thought they might hold all the ships of the world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But of such things Columbus was not in search.  He was seeking for\ngold and jewels, and at every place he touched he hoped to find\nsome great eastern potentate, robed in splendour and seated upon\na golden throne;</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">instead everywhere he found only naked savages.\nThey were friendly and gentle, and what gold they had - but it was\nlittle indeed - they willingly bartered for a few glass beads, or\nlittle tinkling bells.</p><p>By signs, however, some of these savages made Columbus understand\nthat further south there was a great king who was so wealthy that\nhe ate off dishes of wrought gold.  Others told him of a land where\nthe people gathered gold on the beach at night time by the light of\ntorches; others again told him of a land where gold was so common\nthat the people wore it on their arms and legs, and in their ears\nand noses as ornaments.  Others still told of islands where there\nwas more gold than earth.  But Columbus sought these lands in vain.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In his cruisings Columbus found Cuba, and thought at first it must\nbe the island of Cipango, but finding himself mistaken he decided\nat length that he had landed upon the most easterly point of India.\nHe</p>",
  "page-57": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could not be far, he thought, from the palace of the Grand Khan,\nand choosing out two of his company he sent them as ambassadors\nto him.  But after six days the ambassadors returned, having found\nno gold; and instead of the Grand Khan having seen only a savage\nchieftain.</p><p>These ambassadors found no gold, but, had they only known it, they\nfound something quite as valuable.  For they told how they had met\nmen and women with firebrands in their hands made of herbs, the end\nof which they put in their mouths and sucked, blowing forth smoke.\nAnd these fire-brands they called tabacos.</p><p>The Spaniards also discovered that the natives of these islands used\nfor food a root which they dug out of the earth.  But they thought\nnothing of these things.  For what were roots and dried herbs to\nthose who came in search of gold, and gems, and precious spices?\nSo they brought home neither potatoes nor tobacco.</p>",
  "page-58": "<p>So far the three little vessels had kept together, but now the\ncaptain of the Pinta parted company with the others, not because\nof bad weather, says Columbus in his diary, but because he chose,\nand out of greed, for he thought \"that the Indians would show him\nwhere there was much gold.\" This desertion grieved Columbus greatly,\nfor he feared that Pinzon might find gold, and sailing home before\nhim cheat him of all the honour and glory of the quest.  But still\nthe Admiral did not give up, but steered his course \"in the name\nof God and in search of gold and spices, and to discover land.\"</p><p>So from island to island he went seeking gold, and finding everywhere\ngentle, kindly savages, fair birds and flowers, and stately trees.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Many\nof them, however, were so delighted with the islands that they\nwanted to stay there, and they had often asked the Admiral's leave\nto do so.</p><p>Columbus therefore now determined to allow some of his men to\nremain to found a little colony, and trade with the Indians, \"and\nhe trusted in God that when he came back from Spain - as he intended\nto do - he would find a ton of gold collected by them, and that\nthey would have found a gold mine, and such quantities of spices\nthat the Sovereigns would in the space of three years be able to\nundertake a Crusade and conquer the Holy Sepulchre.\"</p>",

  "page-62": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sailed homeward.  But soon storms\narose, the ships were battered by wind, tossed about hither and\nthither by waves, and at length separated again.

  "page-66": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the Old World.  Yet now being made\na noble, he took for his coat of arms a, group of golden islands\nin an azure sea, and for motto the words, \"To Castile and Leon,\nColumbus gave a New World.\"</p><p>Now began a time of pomp and splendour for Columbus.

  "page-68": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and every one knows how to do it.  What he had done\nin sailing across the Sea of Darkness was only wonderful because\nno one ,else had thought of doing it.</p><p>Portugal was now very jealous of Spain's success, and King Ferdinand\nof Spain was fearful lest King John of Portugal should seize the\nnew islands which Columbus had discovered.  So he appealed to the\nPope to settle the matter.  And the Pope decided that all new lands\ndiscovered west of an imaginary line drawn through the Atlantic\nOcean west of the Azores and from pole to pole should belong to\nSpain.  All discoveries east of this line should belong to Portugal.\nIf you will look at a map of the world you will see that this gave\nto Spain all the Americas with their islands (except a little bit\nof Brazil) and to Portugal the whole of Africa.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But almost before this matter was settled Columbus had set forth\nagain on another voyage across the great ocean, now no longer the Sea\nof Darkness: this time he</p>",

  "page-75": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">however, that\nVespucci went on his first voyage in which he explored the coast of\nVenezuela or of Central America.  It is very doubtful which.

So soon,\nwhat with the voyages of Vespucci and the voyages of other great\nmen, it became at last quite certain that there was a vast continent\nbeyond the Atlantic ocean.  Map-makers, therefore, began to draw a\nhuge island, large enough to form in itself a continent, south of\nthe Equator.

It was\nwreathed in flowers, and baskets of corn stood before it.  For the\nIndians looked upon it as an idol, and made offerings to it.  They\nkissed it with a great show of reverence, and begged the Frenchmen\nto do the same. \"Which we would not deny them,\" says Laudonni�re,\nwho himself tells the story, \"to the end we might draw them to be\nmore in friendship with us.\"</p><p>Laudonni�re was so delighted with the natives' friendly greeting\nthat he resolved to found his colony among these kindly Indians.\nSo a little way up the river which Ribaut had named the river of\nMay, but which is now the St.  John's, he built a fort.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was late one evening in June when the Frenchmen reached the\nspot where they intended to build the fort; wearied with their long\nmarch through the forest they</p>",

He commanded a trumpet to\nbe sounded, and when all the men were aroused and stood together\nhe bade them give thanks to God for their safe arrival.  So standing\nbeneath the waving palms, with the deep blue sky arching overhead,\nthe men sang a psalm of thanksgiving and praise.  Then kneeling they\nprayed long and earnestly.</p><p>The prayer ended, the men arose, and full of happy courage turned\nto their work.  Every one took part with right good will.  Some brought\nearth, some cut logs; there was not a man who had not a shovel or\nhatchet or some tool in his hand.  The work went on merrily, and\nsoon above the banks of the river the fort rose, secure and strong,\nfenced and entrenched on every side.  In honour of their King Charles\nthese new colonists called their fort Caroline, just as Ribaut had\ncalled his Charlesfort.</p>",
  "page-110": "<p>But as the native Chief Satouriona watched the fort grow he began\nto be uneasy.

In an open space near\nthe river a huge fire was lit.  In a wide circle round this the\nwarriors gathered.

Beside the fire was placed a large bowl\nof water, and near it Satouriona stood erect, while his braves\nsquatted at his feet.  Standing thus he turned his face, distorted\nwith wrath and hatred, towards the enemy's country.  First he\nmuttered to himself, then he cried aloud to his god the Sun.  And\nwhen he had done this for half an hour he put his hand into the bowl\nof</p>",
  "page-114": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">water, and sprinkled the heads of his braves.  Then suddenly, as\nif in anger, he cast the rest of the water into the fire, putting\nit out.  As he did so he cried aloud:</p><p>\"So may the blood of our enemies be poured out and their lives\nextinguished.\"</p><p>In reply a hoarse yell went up from the savage host, and all the\nwoods resounded with the fiendish noise.</p><p>Thus Satouriona and his braves set forth for battle.  In a few days\nthey returned singing praises to the Sun, and bringing with them\ntwenty-four prisoners and many scalps.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And now Laudonni�re made Satouriona more angry than ever with him.\nFor he demanded two of these prisoners.  Laudonni�re wanted them\nso that he might send them back to the chief of the Thimagoes as a\nproof that he at least was still friendly, for he already regretted\nhis unwise treaty.  But when Satouriona heard Laudonni�re's request\nhe was very angry and treated it</p>",
  "page-115": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with scorn.</p><p>\"Tell your chief,\" he said, \"that he has broken his oath, and I\nwill not give him any of my prisoners.\"</p><p>When Laudonni�re heard this answer he in his turn was very angry,\nand he resolved to frighten Satouriona into obeying him.  So taking\ntwenty soldiers with him he went to the chief's village.  Leaving\nsome of the soldiers at the gate, and charging them to let no\nIndians go in or out, he went into Satouriona's hut with the others.\nIn perfect silence he came in, in perfect silence he sat down and\nremained so for a long time which, says Laudonn�ire, put the chief\n\"deeply in the dumps.\"</p><p>At length when he thought that Satouriona was completely frightened,\nLaudonni�re spoke.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Where are your prisoners?\" he said. \"I command them to be brought\nbefore me.\" Thereupon the chief, \"angry at the heart and astonied\nwonderfully,\" stood a long time without making any answer.  But when\nat last</p>",
  "page-116": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he spoke it was boldly and without fear.</p><p>\"I cannot give you my prisoners,\" he said. \"For seeing you coming\nin such warlike guise they were afraid and fled to the woods.

As soon as they\nwere brought before Laudonni�re the prisoners greeted him humbly.\nThey lifted up their hands to heaven, and then threw themselves at\nhis feet.  But Laudonni�re raised them at once, and led them away\nto the fort, leaving Satouriona very angry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Laudonni�re now sent the prisoners back to the Thimagoes' chief,\nwho was greatly delighted at the</p>",
  "page-117": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">return of his braves.  He was still\nmore delighted when the Frenchmen marched with him against another\ntribe who were his enemies, and defeated them.</p><p>But while Laudonni�re was thus making both friends and enemies\namong the Indians all was not peace in the colony itself.  Many of\nthe adventurers had grown tired of the loneliness and sameness of\nthe life.  The food was bad, the work was hard, and there seemed\nlittle hope that things would ever be better.  And for all their\nhardships it seemed to them the Governor was to blame.  So they\nbegan to murmur and be discontented, gathering together in groups,\nwhispering that it would be a good deed to put an end to Laudonni�re\nand choose another captain.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And now when the discontent was at its height Laudonni�re fell\nill.  Then one of the ringleaders of the discontent urged the doctor\nto put poison in his medicine.  But the doctor refused.  Next they\nformed a</p>",

But Laudonni�re discovered that plot, and the ringleader\nfled to the forest.</p><p>About this time a ship arrived from France bringing food for the\ncolony, so that for a time things went a little better.  And when\nthe ship sailed again for home Laudonni�re sent the worst of the\nmutineers back in it.  In their place the captain left behind some\nof his sailors.  But this proved a bad exchange.  For these sailors\nwere little better than pirates, and very soon they became the\nringleaders in revolt.  They persuaded some of the older colonists\nto join them.  And one day they stole a little ship belonging to the\ncolony, and set off on a plundering expedition to the West Indies.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the seas they led a wild and lawless life, taking and plundering\nSpanish ships.

And day by day the discontent\nincreased.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At last one Sunday morning the men sent a message to Laudonni�re\nasking him to come out to the parade ground to meet them.

  "page-120": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to read\na paper in the name of all the others.  Laudonni�re gave permission.\nThe paper was read.  It was full of complaints about the hard work,\nthe want of food, and other grievances.  It ended with a request\nthat the men should be allowed to take the two ships which were\nbeing built and sail to Spanish possessions in search of food.  In\nfact they wanted to become pirates like those mutineers who had\nalready sailed away.</p><p>Laudonni�re refused to listen to this request.  But he promised that\nas soon as the two ships were finished they should be allowed to\nset out in search of gold mines.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The mutineers separated with gloomy faces; they were by no means\nsatisfied with Laudonni�re's answer, and the discontent was as deep\nas ever.

  "page-121": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Laudonni�re's tyranny.</p><p>Late one night about twenty men all armed to the teeth gathered\ntogether and marched to Laudonni�re's hut.  Arrived there they beat\nloudly on the door demanding entrance.  But Laudonni�re and his few\nremaining friends knew well what this loud summons meant, and they\nrefused to open the door.  The mutineers, however, were not to be\neasily held back; they forced open the door, wounding one man who\ntried to hinder them, and in a few minutes with drawn swords in\nhand, and angry scowls on their faces, they crowded round the sick\nman's bed.  Then holding a gun at his throat they commanded him to\ngive them leave to set forth for Spanish waters.  But the stern old\nHuguenot knew no fear.  Even with the muzzle of the gun against his\nthroat he refused to listen to the demands of the lawless crew.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">His calmness drove them to fury.  With terrible</p>",
  "page-122": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">threats, and more\nterrible oaths, they dragged him from his bed.  Loading him with\nfetters they carried him out of the fort, threw him into a boat\nand rowed him out to the ship which lay anchored in the river.  All\nthe loyal colonists had by this time been disarmed, and the fort\nwas completely in the hands of the mutineers.  Their leader then drew\nup a paper giving them leave to set forth to Spanish possessions.\nAnd this he commanded Laudonni�re to sign.</p><p>Laudonni�re was completely in the power of the mutineers.  He was\na prisoner and ill, but his spirit was unbroken, and he refused to\nsign.  Then the mutineers sent him a message saying that if he did\nnot sign they would come on board the ship and cut his throat.  So,\nseeing no help for it, Laudonni�re signed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The mutineers were now greatly delighted at the success of their\nschemes.  They made haste to finish the two little ships which they\nhad been building, and on</p>",
  "page-123": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the 8th of December they set sail.  As\nthey went they flung taunts at those who stayed behind, calling\nthem fools and dolts and other scornful names, and threatening\nthem with all manner of punishments should they refuse them free\nentrance to the fort on their return.</p><p>As soon as the mutineers were gone Laudonni�re's friends rowed out\nto him, set him free from his fetters, and brought him back to the\ncolony.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They were now but a very small company, but they were at peace with\neach other, and there was plenty to do.  So the weeks went quickly\nby.  They finished the fort, and began to build two new ships to\ntake the place of those which the mutineers had stolen.  But they\nnever thought of tilling the ground and sowing seed to provide\nbread for the future.  Thus more than three months passed.  Then one\nday an Indian brought the news that a strange ship was in sight.\nLaudonni�re at</p>",
  "page-124": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">once sent some men to find out what ship this might\nbe, and whether it was friend or foe.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It proved to be a Spanish vessel which the mutineers had captured\nand which was now manned by them.  But the mutineers who had sailed\naway full of pride and insolence now returned in very humble mood.\nTheir buccaneering had not succeeded as they had hoped.  They were\nstarving, and instead of boldly demanding entrance, and putting\nin force their haughty threats, they were eager to make terms.  But\nLaudonni�re was not sure whether they really came in peace or not.\nSo he sent out a little boat to the mutineers' ship.  On the deck\nof it there was an officer with one or two men only.  But below,\nthirty men, all armed to the teeth, were hidden.  Seeing only these\none or two men in the boat the mutineers let her come alongside.\nBut what was their astonishment when armed men suddenly sprang from\nthe bottom of the boat and swarmed over the sides of</p>",
  "page-125": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their vessel.\nMany of the mutineers were stupid with drink, all of them were\nweak with hunger, and before they could seize their arms, or make\nany resistance, they were overpowered and carried ashore.</p><p>There a court-martial was held, and four of the ringleaders were\ncondemned to death.  But these bold bad men were loath to die.</p><p>\"Comrades,\" said one, turning to the loyal soldiers near, \"will\nyou stand by and see us die thus shamefully?\"</p><p>\"These,\" replied Laudonni�re, sharply, \"are no comrades of mutineers\nand rebels.\"</p><p>All appeals for mercy were in vain.  So the men were shot and their\nbodies hanged on gibbets near the mouth of the river as a lesson\nto rebels.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After this there was peace for a time in Fort Caroline.  But it\nsoon became peace with misery, for the colony began to starve.  The\nlong-expected ship from France did not come.  Rich and fertile land\nspread all</p>",
  "page-126": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">round them, but the colonists had neither ploughed nor\nsown it.  They trusted to France for all their food.  Now for months\nno ships had come, and their supplies were utterly at an end.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So in ever increasing misery the days passed.  Some crawled about the\nmeadows and forest, digging for roots and gathering herbs.  Others\nhaunted the river bed in search of shell-fish.  One man even gathered\nup all the fish bones he could find and ground them to powder to\nmake bread.  But all that they scraped together with so much pain\nand care was hardly enough to keep body and soul together.  They\ngrew so thin that their bones started through the skin.  Gaunt,\nhollow-eyed spectres they lay about the fort sunk in misery, or\ndragged themselves a little way into the forest in search of food.\nUnless help came from France they knew that they must all soon die\na miserable death.  And amid all their misery they clung to that\nlast hope, that help would</p>",
  "page-127": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">come from France.  So, however feeble they\nwere, however faint with hunger, they would crawl in turns to the\ntop of the hill above the fort straining their dimming eyes seaward.\nBut no sail appeared.</p><p>At length they gave up all hope, and determined to leave the hated\nspot.  They had the Spanish ship which the mutineers had captured,\nand another little vessel besides which they had built.  But these\nwere not enough to carry them all to France, so gathering all their\nlast energy they began to build another boat.  The hope of getting\nback to France seemed for a time to put a little strength into their\nfamine stricken bodies.  And while they worked Laudonni�re sailed\nup the river in search of food.  But he returned empty-handed.\nFamishing men cannot work, and soon the colonists began to weary\nof their labours.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The neighbouring Indians, too, who might have given them food, were\nnow their enemies.  They indeed</p>",
  "page-128": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">now and again brought scant supplies\nof fish to the starving men.  But they demanded so much for it that\nsoon the colonists were bare of everything they had possessed.  They\nbartered the very shirts from their backs for food.  And if they\ncomplained of the heavy price the Indians laughed at them.</p><p>\"If thou makest so great account of thy merchandise,\" they jeered,\n\"eat it and we will eat our fish.\"</p><p>But summer passed.  The grain began to ripen, and although the Indians\nsold it grudgingly the colony was relieved from utter misery for\nthe time being.</p><p>But now fresh troubles arose, for the Frenchmen quarreled with the\nchief of the Thimagoes for whose sake they had already made enemies\nof Satouriona and his Indians.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thinking themselves treated in an unfriendly manner by the Thimagoes\nthe Frenchmen seized their</p>",
  "page-129": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">chief, and kept him prisoner until the\nIndians promised to pay a ransom of large quantities of grain.</p><p>The Indians agreed only because they saw no other means of freeing\ntheir chief.  They were furiously angry with the Frenchmen and,\nseething with indignation against them, they refused to pay an\nounce of grain until their chief had been set free: and even then\nthey would not bring it to Fort Caroline, but forced the Frenchmen\nto come for it.  The Frenchmen went, but they very quickly saw\nthat they were in great danger.  For the village swarmed with armed\nwarriors who greeted the colonists with scowls of deepest hatred.\nAfter a few days, therefore, although only a small portion of the\nransom had been paid, the Frenchmen decided to make for home as\nfast as possible.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a hot July morning on which they set off.  Each man besides\nhis gun carried a sack of grain, so the progress was slow.  They had\nnot gone far beyond the</p>",
  "page-130": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">village when a wild war whoop was heard.\nIt was immediately followed by a shower of arrows.  The Frenchmen\nreplied with a hot fire of bullets.  Several of the Indians fell\ndead, and the rest fled howling into the forest.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then the Frenchmen marched on again.  But they had scarcely gone\na quarter of a mile when another war whoop was heard in front.\nIt was answered from behind, and the Frenchmen knew themselves\nsurrounded.

But again and\nagain they returned to the attack, and the Frenchmen had to fight\nevery yard of the way.  At nine o'clock the fight began, and the sun\nwas setting when at length the Indians gave up the pursuit.  When\nthe Frenchmen reached their boats they counted their losses.  Two\nhad been killed, and</p>",
  "page-131": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">twenty-two injured, some of them so badly\nthat they had to be carried on board the boats.  Of all the bags of\ngrain with which they had started out only two remained.  It was a\nmiserable ending to the expedition.</p><p>The plight of the colony was now worse than ever.  The two sacks\nof grain were soon consumed; the feeble efforts at building a ship\nhad come to nothing.  But rather than stay longer the colonists\nresolved to crowd into the two small vessels they had, and sail\nhomeward if only they could gather food enough for the voyage.  But\nwhere to get that food none knew.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One day full of troubled, anxious thoughts Laudonni�re climbed\nthe hill and looked seaward.  Suddenly he saw something which made\nhis heart beat fast, and brought the colour to his wasted cheeks.\nA great ship, its sails gleaming white in the sunlight was making\nfor the mouth of the river.  As he gazed another and still another\nship hove in sight.  Thrilling with</p>",
  "page-132": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">excitement Laudonni�re sent\na messenger down to the fort with all speed to tell the news, and\nwhen they heard it the men who had seemed scarce able to crawl arose\nand danced for joy.

There was something not\naltogether familiar about the cut and rig of the ships.  Were they\nreally the long-looked-for ships from France, or did they belong\nto their deadly and hated enemies, the Spaniards? They were neither\none nor the other.  That little fleet was English, under command\nof the famous admiral, John Hawkins, in search of fresh water of\nwhich they stood much in need.  The English Admiral at once showed\nhimself friendly.  To prove that he came with no evil intent he\nlanded with many of his officers gaily clad, and wearing no arms.\nThe famine-stricken colonists hailed him with</p>",
  "page-133": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">delight, for it seemed\nto them that he came as a deliverer.</p><p>Gravely and kindly Hawkins listened to the tale of misery, yet he\nwas glad enough when he heard that the Frenchmen had decided to\nleave Florida, for he wanted to claim it for Queen Elizabeth and\nEngland.  When, however, he saw the ships in which they meant to\nsail homewards he shook his head. \"It was not possible,\" he said,\n\"for so many souls to cross the broad Atlantic in those tiny\nbarques.\" So he offered to give all the Frenchmen a free passage\nto France in his own ships.  This Laudonni�re refused.  Then Hawkins\noffered to lend him, or sell him, one of his ships.  Even this\nkindness Laudonni�re hesitated to accept.</p><p>Thereupon there arose a great uproar among the colonists, they\ncrowded round him clamouring to be gone, threatening that if he\nrefused the Englishman's offer they would accept it and sail without\nhim.</p>",
  "page-134": "<p>So Laudonni�re yielded.  He told Hawkins that he would buy the\nship he offered, but he had no money.  The Englishman, however, was\ngenerous.  Instead of money he took the cannon and other things now\nuseless to the colonists.  He provided them with food enough for\nthe voyage, and seeing many of the men ragged and barefoot, added\namong other things fifty pairs of shoes.</p><p>Then with kindly good wishes Hawkins said farewell and sailed away,\nleaving behind him many grateful hearts.  As soon as he was gone\nthe Frenchmen began to prepare to depart also.  In a few days all\nwas ready, and they only waited for a fair wind in order to set\nsail.  But as they waited, one day, the fort was again thrown into\na state of excitement by the appearance of another fleet of ships.\nAgain the question was asked, were they friends or foes, Spaniards\nor Frenchmen? At length, after hours of sickening suspense, the\nquestion was answered, they were Frenchmen under the command of\nRibaut.</p>",
  "page-135": "<p>The long-looked-for help had come at last.  It had come when it was\nno longer looked for, when it was indeed unwelcome to many.

Those who had held back, when they saw the fate of their\ncompanions, fled through the forest.  Some sought refuge among the\nIndians.  But even from that refuge the Spaniards hunted them forth\nand slew them without pity.  Thus the land was filled with bloodshed\nand ruin.

But Menendez\nwanted to make sure of the state they were in, and he made up his\nmind to get nearer to the Frenchmen.

And\nin spite of the terrible fate of the Frenchmen he thought Florida\nwould be an excellent place to found an English colony.</p><p>So Raleigh's ships made their way to Florida, and landed on Roanoke\nIsland off the coast of what is now North Carolina.  In those days\nof course there was no Carolina, and the Spaniards called the whole\ncoast Florida right up to the shores of Newfoundland.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Englishmen were delighted with Roanoke.

One of them stole a silver cup, and as it was not returned\nthe Englishmen in anger set fire to the corn-fields and destroyed\nthem.  This was a bad beginning.  But the Englishmen had no knowledge\nyet of how cruel and revengeful the Redman could be.  So it was with\nno misgivings that Sir Richard left a colony of over a hundred men\nin the country.  And promising to return with fresh supplies in the\nfollowing spring he sailed homeward.</p>",
  "page-186": "<p>The Governor of this colony was named Ralph Lane.  He was wise\nand able, but he was soon beset with difficulties.

Then one day, about a\nweek after the fight with the Indians, news was brought to Lane that\na great fleet of</p>",
  "page-188": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">twenty-three ships had appeared in the distance.</p><p>Were they friends, or were they foes?

And when he saw the miserable condition of the\ncolonists, and heard the tale of their hardships, he offered to take\nthem all home</p>",
  "page-189": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to England.  Or, he said, if they chose to remain he\nwould leave them a ship and food and everything that was necessary\nto keep them from want until help should come.</p><p>Both Lane and his chief officers who were men of spirit wanted to\nstay.  So they accepted Drake's offer of the loan of a ship, agreeing\nthat after they had found a good place for a colony and a better\nharbour, they would go home to England and return again the next\nyear.</p><p>Thus the matter was settled.  Drake began to put provisions on board\none of his ships for the use of the colony.  The colonists on their\nside began writing letters to send home with Drake's ships.  All\nwas business and excitement.  But in the midst of it a great storm\narose.  It lasted for four days and was so violent that most of\nDrake's ships were forced to put out to sea lest they should be\ndashed to pieces upon the shore.</p>",

Did it not seem as if\nby driving away their ship God had stretched out His hand to take\nthem from thence? Was the storm not meant as a sign to them?</p><p>So not being able to decide by himself what was best to do, Lane\ncalled his officers and gentlemen together, and asked advice of\nthem.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They all begged him to go home.  No help had come from Sir Richard\nGrenville, nor was it likely to come, for Drake had brought the\nnews that war between Spain and England had been declared.

They brought with them two things\nwhich afterward proved to be of wit great importance.  The first\nwas tobacco.  The use of it had been known ever since the days of\nColumbus, but it was now for the first time brought to England.\nThe second was the potato.  This Raleigh planted on his estates in\nIreland, and to this day Ireland is one of the great potato growing\ncountries of the world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But meanwhile Raleigh had not forgotten his</p>",

Yet he could not believe that it had been abandoned.  So\nhe searched the country up and down in the hope of finding some of\nthe colonists.  But finding no trace of them he at length gave up\nthe search and returned to the forsaken huts.

So whether they would or not he landed the colonists,</p>",
  "page-194": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and\nsailed away, leaving only one small boat with them.</p><p>Thus perforce they had to take up their abode in the old spot.  They\nfound it deserted.  The fort was razed to the ground, and although\nthe huts were still standing they were choked with weeds and\novergrown with wild vines, while deer wandered in and out of the\nopen doors.  It was plain that for many months no man had lived\nthere.  And although careful search was made, saving the bones of\none, no sign was found of the fifteen men left there by Sir Richard.\nAt length the new colonists learned from a few friendly Indians\nthat they had been traitorously set upon by hostile Indians.  Most\nof them were slain; the others escaped in their boat and went no\nman knew whither.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Englishmen were very angry when they heard that, and wanted to\npunish the Indians.

  "page-195": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Indians instead of their enemies.  Thus things were\nmade worse instead of better.</p><p>And now amid all these troubles on the 18th of August, 1587, a\nlittle girl was born.  Her father was Ananias Dare, and her mother\nwas the daughter of John White, the Governor.  The little baby was\nthus the grand-daughter of the Governor, and because she was the\nfirst English child to be born in Virginia she was called Virginia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But matters were not going well in the colony.  Day by day the men\nwere finding out things which were lacking and which they felt\nthey must have if they were not all to perish.  So a few days after\nVirginia was christened all the chief men came to the Governor and\nbegged him to go back to England to get fresh supplies, and other\nthings necessary to the life of the colony.  John White, however,\nrefused to go.  The next day not only the men but the women also came\nto him and again</p>",
  "page-196": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">begged him to go back to England.  They begged so\nhard that at last the Governor consented to go.</p><p>All were agreed that the place they were now in was by no means the\nbest which might be chosen for a colony, and it had been determined\nthat they should move some fifty miles further inland.  Now it was\narranged that if they moved while the Governor was away they should\ncarve on the trees and posts of the door the name of the place to\nwhich they had gone, so that on his return he might be able easily\nto find them.  And also it was arranged that if they were in any\ntrouble or distress they should carve a cross over the name.</p><p>All these matters being settled John White set forth.  And it was\nwith great content that the colonists saw their Governor go.  For\nthey knew that they could send home no better man to look after\ntheir welfare, and they were sure he would bring back the food and\nother things which were needed.</p>",
  "page-197": "<p>But when White arrived in England he found that no man, not even\nRaleigh, had a thought to spare for Virginia.  For Spain was making\nready all her mighty sea power to crush England.  And the English\nwere straining every nerve to meet and break that power.  So John\nWhite had to wait with what patience he could.  Often his heart was\nsick when he thought of his daughter and his little granddaughter,\nVirginia Dare, far away in that great unknown land across the sea.\nOften he longed to be back beside them.  But his longings were of no\navail.  He could but wait.  For every ship was seized by Government\nand pressed into the service of the country.  And while the Spaniards\nwere at the gate it was accounted treason for any Englishman to\nsail to western lands.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So the summer of 1588 passed, the autumn came, and at length the\ngreat Armada sailed from Spain.

  "page-199": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">however, before they reached the spot,\nand seeing no lights save that of a huge fire far in the woods\nthe Governor sounded a trumpet call.  The notes of the trumpet rang\nthrough the woods and died away to silence.  There was no answer.  So\nthe men called and called again, but still no answer came.

Grass and weeds\ngrew in the ruined houses.  But upon a post \"in fair capital letters\"\nwas carved the word \"Croatoan.\" This was the name of a neighbouring\nisland inhabited by friendly Indians.  There was no cross or sign\nof distress carved</p>",

And from\ndiscussing they fell to disputing until it ended at length in a\nbitter quarrel between Smith and another of the adventurers, Captain\nEdward Wingfield.</p><p>Captain Wingfield was twice John Smith's age, and deemed that he knew\nmuch better how a colony ought to be formed than this dictatorial\nyouth of twenty-seven.

And when a fair wind blew at length\nthe ships spread their sails to it and were</p>",
  "page-210": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">soon out of sight of\nEngland.  Two months of storm and danger passed before the adventurers\nsighted the West Indies.  Here they went ashore on the island of\nSan Dominica.  Delighted once more to see land and escape from the\nconfinement of the ship, they stayed three weeks among the sunny\nislands.  They hunted and fished, traded with the savages, boiled\npork in hot natural springs, feasted on fresh food and vegetables,\nand generally enjoyed themselves.</p><p>But among all this merry-making Wingfield did not forget his anger\nagainst John Smith.  Their quarrels became so bad that Wingfield\ndecided to end both quarrels and John Smith.  So he ordered a gallows\nto be set up and, having accused Smith of mutiny, made ready to\nhang him.  But John Smith stoutly defended himself.  Nothing could be\nproved against him.  He laughed at the gallows, and as he quaintly\nputs it \"could not be persuaded to use them.\"</p>",
  "page-211": "<p>Nevertheless, although nothing could be proved against him, there\nwere many who quite agreed that Captain John Smith was a turbulent\nfellow.

Then they sailed on up the river which they named\nJames River, in honour of the King himself.  Their settlement they\nnamed Jamestown, also in his honour.  Jamestown has now disappeared,\nbut the two capes and the river are still called by the names given\nthem by these early settlers.</p>",
  "page-212": "<p>Before this expedition sailed the directors of the Company had\narranged who among the colonists were to be the rulers.  But for\nsome quaint reason they were not told.

Of the council Wingfield was chosen President.  All\nthe others, except John Smith, took oath to do their best for the\ncolony.  Then at once the business of building houses was begun.\nWhile the council drew plans the men dug trenches and felled trees\nin order to clear space on which to pitch their</p>",

But indeed it was one of the\nquaintest churches ever known.  An old sail was stretched beneath\na group of trees to give shelter from the burning sun.  And to make\na pulpit a plank of wood was nailed between two trees which grew\nnear together.  And here good Master Hunt preached twice every\nSunday while the men sat on felled trunks reverently listening to\nhis long sermons.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">While the houses were being built Smith, with some twenty others,\nwas sent to explore the country.  They</p>",
  "page-214": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sailed up the river and found\nthe Indians to all appearance friendly.  But they found no gold\nor precious stones, and could hear nothing of a passage to the\nPacific Ocean which they had been told to seek.  So they returned\nto Jamestown.  Arriving here they found that the day before the\nIndians had attacked the settlement and that one Englishman lay\nslain and seventeen injured.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This was a bitter disappointment to Wingfield who had trusted in\nthe friendliness of the Indians.  But at length he was persuaded to\nallow fortifications to be built.  Even then, however, the colonists\nwere not secure, for as they went about their business felling\ntrees or digging the ground the savages would shoot at them from\nthe shelter of the surrounding forest.  If a man strayed from the\nfort he was sure to return wounded if he returned at all; and in\nthis sort of warfare the stolid English were no match for the wily\nIndians. \"Our men,\"</p>",

He promised to</p>",
  "page-216": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">make all speed he could and to\nbe back in five months' time.  And indeed he had need to hasten.  For\nthe journey outward had been so long, the supply of food so scant,\nthat already it was giving out.  And when Captain Newport sailed it\nwas plain that the colonists had not food enough to last fifteen\nweeks.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Such food it was too! It consisted chiefly of worm-eaten grain.  A\npint was served out daily for each man, and this boiled and made\ninto a sort of porridge formed their chief food.  Their drink was\ncold water.  For tea and coffee were unknown in those days, and\nbeer they had none.  To men used to the beer and beef of England\nin plenty this indeed seemed meagre diet. \"Had we been as free of\nall sins as gluttony and drunkenness,\" says Smith, \"we might have\nbeen canonised as saints, our wheat having fried some twenty-six weeks\nin the ship's hold, contained as many worms as grains, so that we\nmight truly call it rather so much bran than corn.  Our drink</p>",
  "page-217": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was\nwater, our lodging castles in the air.\"</p><p>There was fish enough in the river, game enough in the woods.  But\nthe birds and beasts were so wild, and the men so unskilful and\nignorant in ways of shooting and trapping, that they succeeded\nin catching very little.  Besides which there were few among the\ncolonists who had any idea of what work meant.  More than half the\ncompany were \"gentlemen adventurers,\" dare devil, shiftless men who\nhad joined the expedition in search of excitement with no idea of\nlabouring with their hands.</p><p>Badly fed, unused to the heat of a Virginian summer the men soon\nfell ill.  Their tents were rotten, their houses yet unbuilt.  Trees\nremained unfelled, the land untilled, while the men lay on the bare\nground about the fort groaning and in misery.  Many died, and soon\nthose who remained were so feeble that they had scarce strength\nto bury the dead or even to crawl to the \"common kettle\" for their\ndaily measure of porridge.</p>",
  "page-218": "<p>In their misery the men became suspicious and jealous, and once\nmore quarrels were rife.  Wingfield had never been loved.  Now many\ngrew to hate him, for they believed that while they starved he\nkept back for his own use secret stores of oil and wine and other\ndainties.  No explanations were of any avail, and he was deposed\nfrom his office of President and another chosen in his place.</p><p>As autumn drew on the misery began to lessen.  For the Indians, whose\ncorn was now ripe, began to bring it to the fort to barter it for\nchisels, and beads, and other trifles.  Wild fowl too, such as ducks\nand geese, swarmed in the river.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So with good food and cooler weather the sick soon began to mend.\nEnergy returned to them, and once more they found strength to build\nand thatch their houses.  And led by Smith they made many expeditions\namong the Indians, bringing back great stores of</p>",
  "page-219": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">venison, wild\nturkeys, bread, and grain in exchange for beads, hatchets, bells\nand other knick-knacks.</p><p>But all the misery through which the colonists had passed had taught\nthem nothing.  They took no thought for the time to come when food\nmight again be scarce.  They took no care of it, but feasted daily\non good bread, fish and fowl and \"wild beasts as fat as we could\neat them,\" says Smith.</p><p>Now one December day Smith set out on an exploring expedition up\nthe Chickahominy River.  It was a hard journey, for the river was so\novergrown with trees that the men had to hew a path for the little\nvessel.  At length the barque could go no further, so Smith left it,\nand went on in a canoe with only two Englishmen, and two Indians\nas guides.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For a time all went well.  But one day he and his companions went\nashore to camp.  While the others were preparing a meal, Smith, taking\none of the Indians</p>",
  "page-220": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with him, went on to explore a little further.\nBut he had not gone far when he heard the wild, blood-curdling war\nwhoop of the Indians.  Guessing at once that they had come against\nhim he resolved to sell his life as dearly as might be.  So seizing\nthe Indian guide he tied his arm fast to his own with his garters.\nThen with pistol in his right hand, and holding the Indian in\nfront of him as a shield, he pushed as rapidly as he could in the\ndirection of the camp.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Arrows flew round him thick and fast, but Smith's good buff coat turned\nthem aside.  The whole forest was alive with Indians, but although\nfrom the shelter of the trees they showered arrows upon Smith\nnone dared approach him to take him.  For they knew and dreaded the\nterrible fire stick which he held in his hand.  Smith fired again\nand yet again as he retreated, and more than one Indian fell, never\nmore to rise.  He kept his eyes upon the bushes and trees trying\nto catch glimpses of</p>",
  "page-221": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the dusky figures as they skulked among them,\nand paid little heed to the path he was taking.  So suddenly he\nfound himself floundering in a quagmire.</p><p>Still he fought for dear life, and as long as he held his pistol\nno Redman dared come near to take him.  But at length, chilled and\nwet, and half dead-with cold, unable to go further, he saw it was\nuseless to resist longer.  So he tossed away his pistol.  At once\nthe savages closed in upon and, dragging him out of the quagmire,\nled him to their chief.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Smith had given in because he knew that one man stuck in a quagmire\ncould not hope to keep three hundred Indians long at bay.  But he\nhad sharp wits as well as a steady hand, and with them he still\nfought for his life.  As soon as he was brought before the chief he\nwhipped out his compass, and showing it to the chief, explained to\nhim that it always pointed north, and thus the white men were able\nto find their way through the</p>",
  "page-222": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pathless desert.</p><p>To the Indians this seemed like magic; they marvelled greatly at the\nshining needle which they could see so plainly and yet not touch.\nSeeing their interest Smith went on to explain other marvels of\nthe sun, and moon, and stars, and the roundness of the earth, until\nthose who heard were quite sure he was a great \"medicine man.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thus Smith fought for his life.  But at length utterly exhausted, he\ncould say no more.  So while the chief still held the little ivory\ncompass, and watched the quivering needle, his followers led Smith\naway to his own camp fire.  Here lay the other white men dead, thrust\nthrough with many arrows.  And here the Indians warmed and chafed\nhis benumbed body, and treated him with all the kindness they knew.\nBut that brought Smith little comfort.  For he knew it was the Indian\nway.  A famous warrior might be sure of kindness at their hands if\nthey</p>",
  "page-223": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">meant in the end to slay him with awful torture.</p><p>And so, thoroughly warmed and restored, in less than an hour Smith\nfound himself fast bound to a tree, while grim warriors, terribly\npainted, danced around him, bows and arrows in hand.  They were about\nto slay him when the chief, holding up the compass, bade them lay\ndown their weapons.  Such a medicine man, he had decided, must not\nthus be slain.  So Smith was unbound.</p><p>For some weeks Smith was marched hither and thither from village to\nvillage.  He was kindly enough treated, but he never knew how long\nthe kindness would last, and he constantly expected death.  Yet he\nwas quite calm.  He kept a journal, and in this he set down accounts\nof many strange sights he saw, not knowing if indeed they would\never be read.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length Smith was brought to the wigwam of the great Powhatan*,\nthe chief of chiefs, or Emperor, as</p>",
  "page-224": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">these simple English folk\ncalled him.  To receive the white prisoner the Powhatan put on his\ngreatest bravery.  Feathered and painted, and wearing a wide robe\nof raccoon skins he sat upon a broad couch beside a fire.  On either\nside of him sat one of his wives and behind in grim array stood his\nwarriors, row upon row.  Behind them again stood the squaws.  Their\nfaces and shoulders were painted bright red, about their necks they\nwore chains of white beads, and on their heads the down of white\nbirds.</p><p>It was a weird scene, and the flickering firelight added to its\nstrangeness.  Silent and still as statues the warriors stood.  Then\nas John Smith was led before the chief they raised a wild shout.\nAs that died away to silence one of the Powhatan's squaws rose and\nbrought a basin of water to Smith.  In this he washed his hands,\nand then another squaw brought him a bunch of feathers instead of\na towel, with which to dry them.</p>",
  "page-225": "<p>After this the Indians feasted their prisoner with savage splendour.\nThen a long consultation took place.  What was said Smith knew not.\nHe only knew that his life hung in the balance.  The end of the\nconsultation he felt sure meant life or death for him.</p><p>At length the long talk came to an end.  Two great stones were placed\nbefore the chief.  Then as many as could lay hands on Smith seized\nhim, and dragging him to the stones, they threw him on the ground,\nand laid his head upon them.  Fiercely then they brandished their\nclubs and Smith knew that his last hour had come, and that the\nIndians were about to beat out his brains.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But the raised clubs never fell, for with a cry Pocahontas, the\nchief's young daughter, sprang through the circle of warriors.  She\nstood beside the prisoner pleading for his life.  But the Indians\nwere in no mood to listen to prayers for mercy.  So seeing that all\nher entreaties were in vain she threw herself upon her knees</p>",
  "page-226": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">beside\nSmith, put her arms about his neck, and laid her head upon his,\ncrying out that if they would beat out his brains they should beat\nhers out too.</p><p>Of all his many children the Powhatan loved this little daughter\nbest.  He could deny her nothing.  So Smith's life was saved.  He\nshould live, said the Powhatan, to make hatchets for him, and bells\nand beads for his little daughter.</p><p>Having thus been saved, Smith was looked upon as one of the tribe.\nTwo days later he was admitted as such with fearsome ceremony.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Having painted and decorated himself as frightfully as he could,\nthe Powhatan caused Smith to be taken to a large wigwam in the\nforest.

He did not understand in the least what was\ngoing on, and marvelled greatly what this new</p>",
  "page-227": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ceremony might mean.\nBut he had not sat long before the fire when he heard doleful\nsounds coming from the other side of the curtain.

He did not in the least want to go, but the King had\ncommanded that the Powhatan was to be crowned.  And the King had\nto be obeyed.  He arrived safely at Weronocomoco, and the next day\nwas appointed for the coronation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">First the presents were brought out and set in order.

The Powhatan had never seen a crown,\nand had no idea of its use, nor could he be made to understand that\nhe must kneel to have it put on.</p><p>\"A foul trouble there was,\" says one of the settlers who writes\nabout it.  No persuasions or explanations were of any avail.  The\nEnglishmen knelt down in front of him to show him what he must do.\nThey explained, they persuaded, until they were worn out.

  "page-234": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">about it, and began to think much more of himself,\nand much less of the white people.</p><p>Among others, Smith thought it was nothing but a piece of tomfoolery\nand likely to bring trouble ere long.</p><p>For some months now he had been President, and as President he\nwrote to the London Company, \"For the coronation of Powhatan,\" he\nsaid, \"by whose advice you sent him such presents I know not, but\nthis give me leave to tell you, I fear they will be the confusion\nof us all, ere we hear from you again.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Smith told the Company other plain truths.  They had been sending\nout all sorts of idle fine gentlemen who had never done a day's\nwork in their lives.  They could not fell a tree, and when they\ntried the axe blistered their tender fingers.  Some of them worked\nindeed cheerfully enough, but it took ten of them to do as much work\nas one good workman.  Others were simply stirrers up of mischief.  One\nof these Smith now</p>",
  "page-235": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sent back to England \"lest the company should\ncut his throat.\" And Smith begged the Company to keep those sort of\npeople at home in the future, and send him carpenters and gardeners,\nblacksmiths and masons, and people who could do something.</p><p>Captain Newport now sailed home, and Smith was left to govern the\ncolony and find food for the many hungry mouths.  He went as usual\nto trade with the Indians.  But he found them no longer willing to\nbarter their corn for a little copper or a handful of beads.  They\nnow wanted swords and guns.  The Powhatan too grew weary of seeing\nthe Pale-faces squatting on the land of which he was crowned king.\nHe forgot his vows of friendship With Smith.  All he wanted was to\nsee the Palefaces leave his country.  And the best way to get rid\nof them was to starve them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But although the Powhatan had grown tired of seeing the Pale-faces\nstride like lords through his land,</p>",
  "page-236": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he yet greatly admired them.\nAnd now he wanted more than anything else to have a house, a palace\nas it seemed to him, with windows and fireplaces like those they\nbuilt for themselves at Jamestown.  For in the little native houses\nwhich his followers could build there was no room for the splendid\nfurniture which had been sent to him for his coronation.  So now he\nsent to Smith asking him to send white men to build a house.  Smith\nat once sent some men to begin the work, and soon followed with\nothers.</p><p>On their way to the Powhatan's town Smith and his companions stopped\na night with another friendly chief who warned them to beware of\nthe Powhatan.</p><p>\"You will find him use you well,\" he said. \"But trust him not.  And\nbe sure he hath no chance to seize your arms.  For he hath sent for\nyou only to cut your throats.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">However in spite of this warning Smith decided to go on.  So he\nthanked the friendly chief for his good</p>",
  "page-237": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">counsel, and assuring him\nthat he would love him always for it, he went on his way.</p><p>It was winter time now, and the rivers were half frozen over, the\nland was covered with snow, and icy winds blew over it.  Indeed the\nweather was so bad that for a week Smith and his men could not go\non, but had to take refuge with some friendly Indians.  Here in the\nwarm wigwams they were cosy and jolly.  The savages treated them\nkindly, and fed them well on oysters, fish, game and wild-fowl.\nChristmas came and went while they were with these kindly savages,\nand at length, the weather becoming a little better, they decided\nto push on.  After many adventures they reached the Powhatan's\nvillage.  They were very weary from their long cold journey, and\ntaking possession of the first houses they came to they sent a\nmessage to the Powhatan, telling him that they had come, and asking\nhim to send food.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This the old chief immediately did, and soon they</p>",
  "page-238": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were dining royally\non bread, venison and turkeys.  The next day, too, the Powhatan\nsent them supplies of food.  Then he calmly asked how long they were\ngoing to stay, and when they would be gone.</p><p>At this Smith was greatly astonished, for had not the Powhatan sent\nfor him?</p><p>\"I did not send for you,\" said the wily old savage, \"and if you have\ncome for corn I have none to give you, still less have my people.\nBut,\" he added slyly, \"if perchance you have forty swords I might\nfind forty baskets of corn in exchange for them.\"</p><p>\"You did not send for me?\" said Smith in astonishment. \"How can\nthat be? For I have with me the messengers you sent to ask me to\ncome, and they can vouch for the truth of it.  I marvel that you\ncan be so forgetful.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then, seeing that he could not fool the Pale-faces the old chief\nlaughed merrily, pretending that he had only</p>",
  "page-239": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been joking.  But\nstill he held to it that he would give no corn except in exchange\nfor guns and swords.</p><p>\"Powhatan,\" answered Smith, \"believing your promises to satisfy my\nwants, and out of love to you I sent you my men for your building,\nthereby neglecting mine own needs.  Now by these strange demands you\nthink to undo us and bring us to want indeed.  For you know well as\nI have told you long ago of guns and swords I have none to spare.\nYet steal from you or wrong you I will not, nor yet break that\nfriendship which we have promised each other, unless by bad usage\nyou force me thereto.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When the Powhatan heard Smith speak thus firmly he pretended to give\nway and promised that within two days the English should have all\nthe corn he and his people could spare.  But he added, \"My people fear\nto bring you corn seeing you are all armed, for they say you come\nnot hither for trade, but to invade my country</p>",
  "page-240": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and take possession\nof it.  Therefore to free us of this fear lay aside your weapons,\nfor indeed here they are needless, we being all friends.\"</p><p>With such and many more cunning words the Powhatan sought to make\nCaptain Smith and his men lay aside their arms.  But to all his\npersuasions Smith turned a deaf ear.</p><p>\"Nay,\" he said, \"we have no thought of revenge or cruelty against\nyou.  When your people come to us at Jamestown we receive them with\ntheir bows and arrows.  With you it must be the same.  We wear our\narms even as our clothes.\"</p><p>So seeing that he could not gain his end, the old chief gave in.\nYet one more effort he made to soften the Englishman's heart.</p><p>\"I have never honoured any chief as I have you,\" he said, with\na sigh, \"yet you show me less kindness than any one.  You call me\nfather, but you do just as you like.\"</p>",
  "page-241": "<p>Smith, however, would waste no more time parleying, and gave orders\nfor his men to fetch the corn.  But while he was busy with this\nthe Powhatan slipped away and gathered his warriors.  Then suddenly\nin the midst of their business Smith and one or two others found\nthemselves cut off from their comrades, and surrounded by a yelling\ncrowd of painted savages.  Instantly the Englishmen drew their\nswords and, charging into the savages, put them to flight.

Oh, if\nyou would live you must flee at once,\" and as she spoke the tears\nran down her cheeks.</p><p>The Englishmen were truly grateful to Pocahontas for her warning.\nThey thanked her warmly, and would have laden her with gifts of\nbeads and coloured cloth, and such things as the Indians delighted\nin, but she would not take them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I dare not take such things,\" she said. \"For if my</p>",
  "page-244": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">father saw\nme with them he would know that I had come here to warn you, and\nhe would kill me.\" So with eyes blinded with tears, and her heart\nfilled with dread, she slipped out of the fire-lit hut, and vanished\ninto the darkness of the forest as suddenly and silently as she\nhad come.</p><p>Left alone, the Englishmen, cocking their guns and drawing their\nswords, awaited the coming of the foe.  Presently eight or ten lusty\nfellows arrived, each bearing a great platter of food steaming hot\nand excellent to smell.  They were very anxious that the Englishmen\nshould at once lay aside their arms and sit down to supper.  But\nCaptain Smith would take no chances.  Loaded gun in hand he stood\nover the messengers and made them taste each dish to be certain\nthat none of them were poisoned.  Having done this he sent the men\naway. \"And bid your master make haste,\" he said, \"for we are ready\nfor him.\"</p>",
  "page-245": "<p>Then the Englishmen sat down to supper; but they had no thought of\nsleep and all night long they kept watch.</p><p>Powhatan too kept watch, and every now and again he would send\nmessengers to find out what the Englishmen were about.  But each\ntime they came the savages found the Englishmen on guard, so they\ndared not attack.  At last day dawned, and with the rising tide the\nEnglishmen sailed away, still to all seeming on friendly terms with\nthe wily Indians.</p><p>Smith had now food enough to keep the colony from starvation for\na short time at least.  But his troubles were by no means over.  The\nIndians were still often unfriendly, and the colonists themselves\nlazy and unruly.  Some indeed worked well and cheerfully, but many\nwandered about idly, doing nothing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length it came about that thirty or forty men did all the work,\nthe others being simply idle loiterers. </p>",
  "page-246": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Seeing this, Smith called\nall the colonists together one day and told them that he would\nsuffer the idleness no longer. \"Every one must do his share,\" he\nsaid, \"and he who will not work shall not eat.\" And so powerful\nhad he grown that he was obeyed.  The idle were forced to work, and\nsoon houses were built and land cleared and tilled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length there seemed good hope that the colony would prosper.\nBut now another misfortune befell it.  For it was found that rats\nhad got into the granaries and eaten nearly all the store of corn.\nSo once again expeditions set forth to visit the Indians and gather\nmore from them.  But their supply, too, was running short; harvest\nwas still a long way off, and all the colonists could collect\nwas not enough to keep them from starvation.  So seeing this Smith\ndivided his men into companies, sending some down the river to\nfish, and others into the woods to gather roots and wild</p>",
  "page-247": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">berries.\nBut the lazy ones liked this little.  They would have bartered\naway their tools and firearms to the savages for a few handfuls of\nmeal rather than work so hard.  They indeed became so mutinous that\nSmith hardly knew what to do with them.  But at length he discovered\nthe ringleader of these \"gluttonous loiterers.\" Him he \"worthily\npunished,\" and calling the others together, he told them very\nplainly that any man among them who did not do his share should\nbe banished from the fort as a drone, till he mended his ways or\nstarved.</p><p>To the idlers Smith seemed a cruel task-master; still they obeyed\nhim.  So the colony was held together, although in misery and hunger\nand without hope for the future.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length one day to the men on the river there came a joyful sight.\nThey saw a ship slowly sailing towards them.  They could hardly\nbelieve their eyes, for no ship was expected; but they greeted it\nwith all the more joy.  It</p>",
  "page-248": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was a ship under Captain Samuel Argall,\ncome, it is true, not to bring supplies, but to trade.  Finding,\nhowever, that there was no hope of trade Captain Argall shared what\nfood he had with the famished colonists, and so for a time rescued\nthem from starvation.  He also brought the news that more ships were\nsetting out from home bringing both food and men.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In June, 1609, this fleet of nine ships really did set out.  But\none ship was wrecked on the way, another, the Sea Venture, was cast\nashore on the Bermudas; only seven arrived at length at Jamestown,\nbringing many new colonists.  Unfortunately among these new arrivals\nthere were few likely to make good colonists.  They were indeed for\nthe most part wild, bad men whose friends had packed them off to\nthat distant land in the hope of being rid of them forever. \"They\nwere,\" said one of the old colonists who wrote of them, \"ten times\nmore fit to spoil a Commonwealth than either to begin one or</p>",
  "page-249": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">but\nhelp to maintain one.\"</p><p>Now with all these \"unruly gallants\" poured into his little commonwealth\nSmith found his position of President even more difficult than\nbefore.  Still, for a time, if he could not keep them altogether in\norder he at least kept them in check.</p><p>Then one day by a terrible accident his rule was brought to a sudden\nend.  He was returning from an expedition up the James River when,\nthrough some carelessness, a bag of gunpowder in his boat was\nexploded.  Smith was not killed by it, but he was sorely hurt.  In\ngreat pain, and no longer able to think and act for others, he was\ncarried back to Jamestown.</p><p>Here there was no doctor of any kind, and seeing himself then only\na useless hulk, and in danger of death, Smith gave up his post,\nand leaving the colony, for which during two and a half years he\nhad worked and thought and fought so hard, he sailed homeward.</p>",
  "page-250": "<p>Many of the unruly sort were glad to see him go, but his old\ncompanions with whom he had shared so many dangers and privations\nwere filled with grief. \"He ever hated baseness, sloth, pride and\nindignity,\" said one of them. \"He never allowed more for himself\nthan for his soldiers with him.  Upon no danger would he send them\nwhere he would not lead them himself.  He would never see us want\nwhat he either had or could by any means get us.

So sending for the chief he told\nhim he must bring Pocahontas on board his ship.</p><p>But the chief was afraid and refused to do this.</p><p>\"Then we are no longer brothers and friends,\" said Argall.</p>",
  "page-266": "<p>\"My father,\" said the chief, \"be not wroth.  For if I do this thing\nthe Powhatan will make war upon me and upon my people.\"</p><p>\"My brother,\" said Argall,\" have no fear; if so be that the\nPowhatan shall make war upon you I will join with you against him\nto overthrow him utterly.  I mean, moreover, no manner of hurt to\nPocahontas, but will only keep her as hostage until peace be made\nbetween the Powhatan and the Pale-faces.

So he\npromised to do as Argall asked, and began to cast about for an excuse\nfor getting Pocahontas on board.  Soon he fell upon a plan.  He bade\nhis wife pretend that she was very anxious to see the Englishman's\nship.  But when she asked to be taken on board he refused to go with\nher.  Again and again she</p>",
  "page-267": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">asked.  Again and again the chief refused.\nThen the poor lady wept with disappointment and at length the chief,\npretending to be very angry, swore that he would beat her if she\ndid not cease her asking and her tears.  But as she still begged\nand wept he said he would take her if Pocahontas would go too.</p><p>To please the old woman Pocahontas went.  Captain Argall received\nall three very courteously, and made a great feast for them in his\ncabin.  The old chief, however, was so eager to get his promised\nkettle that he could little enjoy the feast, but kept kicking\nCaptain Argall under the table as much as to say, \"I have done my\npart, now you do yours.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At length Captain Argall told Pocahontas that she must stay with\nhim until peace was made between her father and the white men.  As\nsoon as the old chief and his wife heard that they began to howl,\nand cry, and make a great noise, so as to pretend that they</p>",
  "page-268": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">knew\nnothing about the plot.  Pocahontas too began to cry.  But Argall\nassured her that no harm was intended her, and that she need have\nno fear.  So she was soon comforted and dried her eyes.</p><p>As for the wily old Indians they were made quite happy with the\ncopper kettle and a few other trifles, and went merrily back to\nthe shore.</p><p>A messenger was then sent to the Powhatan telling him that his\ndaughter, whom he loved so dearly, was a prisoner, and that he\ncould only ransom her by sending back all the Pale-faces he held\nprisoner, with all their guns, swords and tools which he had stolen.</p><p>When Powhatan got this news he was both angry and sorry.  For he\nloved his daughter very dearly, but he loved the Englishmen's tools\nand weapons almost more.  He did not know what to do, so for three\nmonths he did nothing.  Then at last he sent back seven of his\nprisoners, each one carrying a useless gun.</p>",
  "page-269": "<p>\"Tell your chieftain,\" he said, \"that all the rest of the arms of\nthe Pale-faces are lost, or have been stolen from me.  But if the\nPale-faces will give back my daughter I will give satisfaction\nfor all the other things I have taken, together with five hundred\nbushels of corn, and will make peace forever.\"</p><p>But the Englishmen were not easily deceived.  They returned a message\nto the chief saying, \"Your daughter is well used.  But we do not\nbelieve the rest of our arms are either lost or stolen, and therefore\nuntil you send them we will keep your daughter.\"</p><p>The Powhatan was so angry when he got this message that for a long\ntime he would have no further dealings with the Pale-faces, but\ncontinued to vex and harass them as much as he could.</p><p>At length Sir Thomas Dale, seeking to put an end to this, took\nPocahontas, and with a hundred and fifty men sailed up the river\nto the Powhatan's chief town.</p>",
  "page-270": "<p>As soon as the savages saw the white men they came down to the river's\nbank, jeering at them and insulting them, haughtily demanding why\nthey had come.</p><p>\"We have brought the Powhatan's daughter,\" replied the Englishmen.\n\"For we are come to receive the ransom promised, and if you do not\ngive it willingly we will take it by force.\"</p><p>But the savages were not in the least afraid at that threat.

This reception made the\nEnglishmen angry, so without more ado they launched their boats and\nmade for the shore.  The savages fled at their coming, and so enraged\nwere the colonists against them that they burned their houses, and\nutterly destroyed their town.  Then they sailed on up the river in\npursuit of the Redmen.</p><p>Next day they came up again with the savages.  They were now not so\ninsolent and sent a messenger to ask why the Pale-faces had burned\ntheir town.</p><p>\"Why did you fire upon us?\" asked the Englishmen, sternly.</p><p>\"Brothers,\" replied the Redmen, \"we did not fire upon you.

But for eight\nyears the Redmen had been at peace with their white brothers, and\nthe settlers had lost all fear of attack from them.

Next morning in many places the Indians were\nsitting at breakfast with the settlers and their families when\nsuddenly, as at a given signal, they sprang up, and, seizing the\nsettlers own weapons, killed them all, sparing neither men, women\nnor children.  So sudden was the onslaught that many a man fell dead\nwithout a cry, seeing not the hand which smote him.  In the workshops,\nin the fields, in the gardens, wherever they were, wherever their\ndaily work took them, they were thus suddenly and awfully struck\ndown.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For days and weeks the Indians had watched the habits of the\nsettlers until they knew the daily haunts of every man.

The land was so fertile that he did not need\nto work half so hard to earn a living as he had to do at home;\nwhile the climate was far kindlier.</p><p>So the colony prospered.  And it was to this prosperous colony\nthat in 1642 Sir William Berkeley was appointed Governor.  He was\na courtly, hot-tempered, imperious gentleman, a thorough cavalier\nwho dressed in satin and lace and ruled like a tyrant.  He did not\nbelieve in freedom of thought, and he spent a good deal of time\npersecuting the Puritans who had found refuge in Virginia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For just about the time of Berkeley's appointment a fierce religious\nwar between Cavalier and Puritan was beginning in England, and\nalready some Puritans had</p>",

God keep us from both.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In England the quarrel between King and people grew ever fiercer\nand more bitter.  Virginia so far away heard the echo of it, and\nthere, as in England, men took sides.  The men in Virginia were\nready enough to stand up to the King and speak their mind when</p>",
  "page-313": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he\nthreatened their liberties.  But when they heard that the people in\nEngland had taken the King prisoner and were talking of beheading\nhim they were horrified.  To lay bands upon his person, to lead him\nto the block, to take his life! That seemed to them very terrible.\nAnd when at length the news of the King's death reached Virginia\nthe Virginians forgot their grievances, they became King's men.\nAnd Berkeley, a fervent Royalist, wrote to his brother Royalists at\nhome asking them to come out to Virginia, there to find new homes\nfar from the rule of the hated \"usurper\" Cromwell.</p><p>Many came, fleeing from their native land \"in horror and despairs\nat the bloody and bitter stroke.\" Before the year was out at least\na thousand Cavaliers had found a home in Virginia.

They had to submit, and take the\noath of allegiance to the British Parliament.  Those who refused\nwere given a year's time in which to leave the colony.  And as for\ntheir love of the King? Why, they might pray for him, and drink\nhis health in private, and no man would hinder them.  Only in public\nsuch things would not be tolerated.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In bitterness of heart the Cavalier Governor gave up his post, sold\nhis house in Jamestown, and went away to</p>",

Here amid his apple-trees and orchards he\nlived in a sort of rural state, riding forth in his great coach,\nand welcoming with open arms the Cavaliers who came to him for aid\nand comfort in those evil times.</p><p>These Cavaliers were men and women of good family.  They came from\nthe great houses of England, and in their new homes they continued to\nlead much the same life as they had done at home.  So in Virginia.\nthere grew up a Cavalier society, a society of men and women\naccustomed to command, accustomed to be waited upon; who drove\nabout in gilded coaches, and dressed in silks and velvets.  Thus the\nplain Virginian farmer became a country squire.

He took away the\nright from a good many people.  When he came back to power too he\nfound the House of Burgesses much to his liking.  So instead of having\nit re-elected every year he kept the same members for fourteen years\nlest the people should elect others who would not do his bidding.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This made the people discontented.

  "page-319": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">before, but had never really been put in\nforce in America.  By this Law it was ordered that no goods should\nbe exported from the colonies in America except in British ships.\nFurther it was ordered that the colonies should not trade with any\ncountry save England and Ireland or \"some other of His Majesty's\nsaid plantations.\" It was a foolish law, meant to hurt the Dutch,\nand put gold into the pockets of British merchants.  Instead it\ndrove the colonies to rebellion.</p><p>Virginia had yet another grievance.  Virginia, which for eight years\nhad been self-governing, Virginia which had begun to feel that\nshe had a life of her own, a place of her own among the nations,\nsuddenly found herself given away like some worthless chattel to two\nof the King's favourites -the Earl of Arlington and Lord Culpeper.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The careless, laughter-loving King owed much to his friends who\nhad rescued him from beggary, and set him</p>",

If they really\ndesired that wild land beyond the seas, where only savages lived,\nand where the weed which his pompous grandfather had disliked so much\ngrew, why they should have it! So he carelessly signed his royal\nname and for a yearly rent of forty shillings \"all that dominion of\nland and water commonly called Virginia\" was theirs for the space\nof thirty-one years.</p><p>It was but a scratch of the pen to the King.

So\none August he gathered a company of friends, and set forth on an\nexploring expedition.  With servants and Indian guides they made\na party of about fifty or so, and a jolly company they were.

Then they went down into the valley below, and\non the banks of the river they buried a bottle, inside which they\nhad put a paper declaring that the whole valley belonged to George\nI, King by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France, Ireland and\nVirginia.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After that the merry party turned homewards.

Some of the adventurers\nwere so discouraged with the cold and bleak appearance of the land\nthat they sailed home again in the ship which had brought them\nout.  Only about forty-five or so stayed on.  The winter was long\nand cold, and they were so weary of it, so homesick and miserable,\nthat when in the spring a ship came out with provisions they all\nsailed home again.

In the first place be went \"to take whales, and also to\nmake trials of a mine of gold and of</p>",
  "page-353": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">copper\" and in the long run\nhe hoped to found a colony.</p><p>It was he who changed the name from North Virginia to New England,\nby which name it has ever since been known.  He also named the great\nriver which he found there Charles River after Prince Charles,\nwho later became King Charles I, and all along the coast he marked\nplaces with the names of English towns, one of which he named\nPlymouth.</p><p>But Smith did not succeed in founding a colony in New England;\nand several adventurers who followed him had no better success.\nThe difficulties to be overcome were great, and in order to found\na colony on that inhospitable coast men of tremendous purpose and\nendurance were needed.  At length these men appeared.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nowadays a man may believe what he likes either in the way of politics\nor religion.

  "page-354": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">may write and make speeches about his\nopinions.  Probably no one will listen to him; certainly he will\nnot be imprisoned for mere opinions.  It is the same with religion.\nA man may go to any church he likes, or go to none.  He may write\nbooks or preach sermons, and no one will hinder him.</p><p>But in the days of King James things were very different.  In those\ndays there was little freedom either in thought or action, in\nreligion or politics.  As we have seen King James could not endure\nthe thought that his colony should be self-governing and free to\nmake laws for itself.  Consequently he took its charter away.  In\nreligion it was just the same.  In England at the Reformation the\nKing had been made head of the Church.  And if people did not believe\nwhat the King and Clergy told them to believe they were sure, sooner\nor later, to be punished for it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now in England more and more people began to</p>",
  "page-355": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">think for themselves\non matters of religion.  More and more people found it difficult to\nbelieve as King and Clergy wished them to believe.  Some found the\nChurch of England far too like the old Church of Rome.  They wanted\nto do away with all pomp and ceremony and have things quite simple.\nThey did not wish to separate from the Church; they only wanted to\nmake the Church clean and pure of all its errors.  So they got the\nname of Puritans.  Others however quite despaired of making the Church\npure.  They desired to leave it altogether and set up a Church of\ntheir own.  They were called Separatists, or sometimes, from the\nname of a man who was one of their chief leaders, Brownists.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These Brownists did not want to have bishops and priests, and they\nwould not own the King as head of the Church.  Instead of going\nto church they used to meet together in private houses, there to\npray to God in the manner in which their own hearts told them was\nright. </p>",
  "page-356": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">This of course was considered treason and foul wickedness.\nSo on all hands the Brownists were persecuted.  They were fined and\nimprisoned, some were even hanged.  But all this persecution was in\nvain, and the number of Separatists instead of decreasing increased\nas years went on.</p><p>Now at Scrooby, a tiny village in Nottinghamshire, England, and\nin other villages round, both in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire,\nthere were a number of Separatists.  Every Sunday these people would\nwalk long distances to some appointed place, very likely to Scrooby,\nor to Babworth, where there was a grave and reverent preacher, to\nhold their meetings.</p><p>But they were never left long in peace.  They were hunted and persecuted\non every side, till at length they decided to go to Holland where\nthey heard there was freedom of religion for all men.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To many of them this was a desperate adventure.  In</p>",
  "page-357": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">those days few\nmen traveled.  For the most part people lived and died without once\nleaving their native villages.  To go into a new country, to learn\na new language, to get their living they know not how, seemed to\nsome a misery almost worse than death.  Still they determined to\ngo, such was their eagerness to serve God aright.</p><p>The going was not easy.  They were harassed and hindered in every\nfashion.  Again and again evil men cheated them, and robbed them\nof almost all they possessed, leaving them starving and penniless\nupon the sea shore.  But at length, overcoming all difficulties, in\none way or another, they all reached Amsterdam.</p><p>Even here however they did not find the full freedom and peace\nwhich they desired, and they next moved to Leyden.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They found it \"a beautiful city and of a sweet situation.\" Here\nthey settled down and for some years lived in comfort, earning\ntheir living by weaving and</p>",
  "page-358": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">such employments, and worshipping God\nat peace in their own fashion.</p><p>But after about eleven or twelve years they began once more to think\nof moving.  They had many reasons for this, one being that if they\nstayed longer in Holland their children and grandchildren would\nforget how to speak English, and in a few generations they would\nno longer be English, but Dutch.  So they determined to go to some\nplace where they could still remain English, and yet worship God\nas they thought right.</p><p>And the place their thoughts turned to was the vast and unpeopled\ncountry of America.  But which part of America they could not at\nfirst decide.  After much talk however they at length decided to\nask the Virginian Company to allow them to settle in their land,\nbut as a separate colony, so that they might still have religious\nfreedom.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Two messengers were therefore despatched to</p>",
  "page-359": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">London to arrange\nmatters with the company.  The Virginian Company was quite willing\nto have these Separatists as settlers.  But do what they would they\ncould not get the King to promise them freedom to worship God.  All\nthat they could wring from him was a promise that he would take\nno notice of them so long as they behaved peaceably.  To allow or\ntolerate them by his public authority, under his broad seal, was\nnot to be thought of.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That was the best the Virginian Company or any of their friends\ncould do for the Separatists.  And with this answer the messengers\nwere obliged to return to Leyden.  When the English men and women\nthere heard it they were much disturbed.  Some felt that without\nbetter assurance of peace they would be foolish to leave their safe\nrefuge.  But the greater part decided that poor though the assurance\nwas they would be well to go, trusting in God to bring them safely\nout of all their</p>",
  "page-360": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">troubles.  And after all they reflected \"a seal as\nbroad as the house floor would not serve the turn\" if James did not\nwish to keep his promise, so little trust did they put in princes\nand their oaths.</p><p>So it was decided to go to the New World, and after much trouble\neverything was got ready.  A little ship called the Speedwell was\nbought and fitted up.  Then those who had determined to go went down\nto the sea shore accompanied by all their friends.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Their hearts were heavy as they left the beautiful city which had\nbeen their home for the last twelve years.  But they knew that they\nwere pilgrims and strangers upon the earth, and they looked only\nto find in heaven an abiding place.  So steadfastly they set their\nfaces towards the sea.  They went on board, their friends following\nsorrowfully.  Then came the sad parting.  They clung to each other\nwith tears, their words of farewell and prayers broken by sobs.  It\nwas so pitiful a sight that even</p>",

But they had not gone far before the captain of the\nSpeedwell complained that his ship was leaking so badly that he\ndared not go on.  So both ships put in to Dartmouth, and here the\nSpeedwell was thoroughly overhauled and mended, and again they set\nout.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But still the captain declared that the Speedwell was leaking.  So\nonce more the pilgrims put back, this time to Plymouth.  And here\nit was decided that the</p>",
  "page-362": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Speedwell was unseaworthy, and unfit to\nventure across the great ocean.  That she was a rotten little boat\nis fairly certain, but it is also fairly certain that the Captain\ndid not want to sail to America, and therefore he made the worst,\ninstead of the best, of his ship.</p><p>If it is true that he did not want to cross the ocean he now had\nhis way.  For the Speedwell was sent back to London with all those\nwho had already grown tired of the venture, or who had grown fearful\nbecause of the many mishaps.  And the Mayflower, taking the rest\nof the passengers from the Speedwell, and as many of the stores as\nshe could find room for, proceeded upon her voyage alone.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Among those who sailed in her were Captain Miles Standish and Master\nMullins with his fair young daughter Priscilla.

With tears\nstreaming down their faces, the Pilgrims knelt upon the shore and\nsaw the Mayflower go, following her with prayers and blessings until\nshe was out of sight.

But very soon he returned, bringing Squanto and\nthe chief, Yellow Feather, with him.  Then there was a very solemn\npow-wow; the savages gorgeous in paint and feathers sat beside the\nsad-faced Englishmen in their tall black hats and sober clothes,\nand together they swore friendship and peace.  And so long as Yellow\nFeather lived this peace lasted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After the meeting Yellow Feather went home to his own wigwams,\nwhich were about forty miles away.

Even then he feared to be parted from his white friends,\nand he begged them to pray God that he too might be allowed to go\nto the Englishmen's heaven.</p><p>Besides Yellow Feather and his tribe there were other Indians who\nlived to the east of the settlement, and they were by no means\nso friendly.  At harvest time they used to steal the corn from the\nfields and otherwise harass the workers.  As they went unpunished\nthey grew ever bolder until at length one day their chief, Canonicus,\nsent a messenger to the Governor with a bundle of arrows tied\nabout with a large snakeskin.

He sent\nback the snakeskin stuffed with bullets and gunpowder, and with it\na bold message.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"If you would rather have war than peace,\" he said,</p>",

Thus the Pilgrims had\npeace with the Redmen.  They had also set matters right with the\nPlymouth Company, and had received from them a patent or charter\nallowing them to settle in New England.

And, driven by the tyranny of\nKing James and of his son Charles I, small companies of Puritans\nbegan to follow the example of the Pilgrim Fathers and go out to\nNew England, there to seek freedom to worship God.  For King James,\nalthough brought up as a Presbyterian himself, was bitter</p>",

King James has\nbeen called the British Solomon, but he did some amazingly foolish\nthings.  This narrow-minded persecution of the Puritans was one.\nYet by it he helped to form a great nation.  So perhaps he was not\nso foolish after all.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As has been said many companies were formed, many land charters\ngranted for Northern Virginia, or New England, as it was now called.\nAt length a company of Puritans under the name of the Massachusetts\nBay Company got a charter from Charles I, granting them a large\ntract of land from three miles south of the Charles River to three\nmiles north of the Merrimac, and as far west as the Pacific.

Nowhere in the charter did it\nsay that the seat of government must be in England.</p><p>So when Charles dismissed his Parliament, vowing that if the members\nwould not do as he wished he would rule without them, a great many\nPuritans decided to leave the country.

A new Governor was chosen every year,\nbut John Winthrop held the post many times, twice being elected\nthree years in succession.  Although we may think that he was narrow\nin some things, he was a man of calm judgment and even temper, and\nwas in many ways a good Governor.  From the day he set forth from\nEngland to the end of his life he kept a diary, and it is from\nthis diary that we learn nearly all we know of the early days of\nthe colony.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was in June of 1630 that Winthrop and his company landed at\nSalem, and although there were</p>",

They refused also to take\noath of any kind, even the oath of allegiance to the King, because\nChrist had said, \"Swear not at all.\" They used \"thee\" and \"thou\"\ninstead of \"you\" in speaking to a single person (because they thought\nit more simple and truthful), and they refused to say \"goodnight\"\nor \"goodmorrow,\" \"for they knew night was good and day was good\nwithout wishing either.\" There was a great deal that was good in\ntheir religion and very little, it would seem, that was harmful,\nbut they were pronounced to be \"mischievous and dangerous people.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Men did not understand the Quakers.

In answer to this\npetition the King granted a great tract of land to Gorges and Mason.\nThis they called Laconia, because it was supposed to contain many\nlakes.

Thus it happened that\nIngoldsby, the Lieutenant-Governor, arrived in New York without the\nGovernor.  However he sent to Leisler asking him to allow the soldiers\nhe had brought to enter the fort.

Later, however, seeing that his\nson was quite determined to be a Quaker, the Admiral forgave him,\nand before he died he asked the Duke of York to be kind to him.\nThe Duke of York promised he would.

So at length (exactly when we do not\nknow), the idea of founding a real Quaker colony came into Penn's\nmind.</p><p>When Admiral Penn died the King owed him �16,000 and William Penn\ninherited that claim.  So he asked the King to pay the debt not\nin money but in land in America.  The extent of the land asked for\nwas exceedingly vague, but it was at least as big as the whole of\nEngland.  Charles however was always in want of money.  So in 1681\nhe was pleased enough to give away this great tract of land, which\nafter all was his more by imagination than anything else, and get\nrid of his debt; and acquire also the possibility of getting some\ngold as well.  For in return for his land Penn agreed to pay two\nbeaver skins a year, and a fifth of all the gold or silver which\nmight be mined within his territory.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Charles not only gave Penn the land, but named it</p>",
  "page-534": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">too.  Penn meant\nto call his new country New Wales, but a Welshman who hated the\nQuakers objected to the name of his land being given to a Quaker\ncolony, so Penn changed it to Sylvania, meaning Woodland, because\nof the magnificent forests which were there.  But the King added\nPenn to Sylvania thus calling it Penn's Woodlands.</p><p>William Penn, however, was afraid that people would think that this\nwas vanity on his part, and that he had called his province after\nhimself; so he tried to have the name changed.  He even bribed the\nKing's secretary to do it, but in vain.  As some one has said, if\nhe had bribed the King himself he might have succeeded better.  As\nit was he did not succeed, for King Charles was very pleased with\nthe name.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"No,\" laughed the merry monarch, when Penn asked him to change it,\n\"we will keep the name, but you need not flatter yourself that it\nis called after you.

It had only one fault, and\nthat was that it had no sea coast.</p><p>In a new country where there were no roads, and where communication\ninland was difficult that was a great drawback.  So Penn persuaded\nthe Duke of York to give him that part of his province on which the\nSwedes had settled and which the Dutch had taken from the Swedes,\non the west shores of Delaware Bay.  Later this formed the State\nof Delaware, but in the meantime it was governed as a part of\nPennsylvania.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Everything thus being settled, and the charter being granted, Penn\ndrew up a form of government for his</p>",

You shall be\ngoverned by laws of your own making, and live a free and, if you\nwill, a sober and industrious people.

But no state wanted to give up any of its privileges,\nand it seemed hopeless to institute one Central Government, for each\nstate thought only of itself, and each one was afraid of giving\nCongress too much power lest it should usurp the power of the state\ngovernment.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The states quarreled with each other about their boundaries, some\nof them made absurd claims to vast territory on the strength of\ntheir royal charters, quite</p>",

In 1765, however, King George III\nhad decided that the land belonged to New York, and must be under\nthe rule of that colony.  The people, however, rebelled.

Now these old quarrels were forgotten.\nNew York no longer claimed the land, and Vermont joined the Union\nas the fourteenth state.</p><p>In the following year another state was added to the Union.  This\nwas the State of Kentucky.  It was, like several other states, an\noffshoot of Virginia, and carved out of the territory which Virginia\nclaimed by right of her old charter which gave her all the land\nbetween the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Among the early settlers of Kentucky was a famous hunter named\nDaniel Boone.

He could imitate the gobble of the turkey, or the\nchatter of a squirrel, and follow a trail better than any Indian.\nIt was with no idea of helping to found a state, but rather from\na wish to get far from the haunts of his fellowmen that he moved\naway into the beautiful wilds of Kentucky.</p><p>In those days Kentucky was not inhabited by any tribe of Indians,\nbut it was their hunting ground, and they were very angry when\nthey saw white men come to settle there and spoil their hunting.

The man, steadied by his leader's\ncalm voice, did as he was told and in a few minutes was able to drag\nhimself up to the top of the cliff.  Then on his hands and knees he\ncrawled along till he was again in safety.</p><p>After two months the travelers reached the great falls of the\nMissouri River.  Here they had to leave the water, and carry their\nboats overland until they arrived above the rapids.  It was no\neasy matter and they were all by this time worn and weary.  So they\ncamped for a few days, and made a rough sort of cart on which to\ncarry the boats.  For they were too worn out to carry them on their\nshoulders.

But first of all the new President\nturned this thoughts to home matters.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ever since the McKinley Tariff the duties on goods imported into\nthe country had remained high.  Many people, however, had come to\nbelieve that high tariffs were a mistake, for while they enriched\na few they made living dearer than need be for many.

  "page-1185": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">They objected to tariffs merely for\n\"protection.\" That is, they objected to tariffs which \"protected\"\nthe manufacturer at the expense of the consumer.</p><p>President Wilson held these opinions strongly, and during the first\nyear of his presidency a bill was passed by which were luxuries,\nthings which only rich people bought, were heavily taxed, while the\ntaxes on foodstuffs and wool, things which the poorest need, were\nmade much lighter.  These changes in the tariff brought in much less\nincome for the government, and to make up for the loss an Income\nTax was levied for the first time, everyone who had more than 4,000\ndollars a year having to pay it.  In this way again the burden of\ntaxes was shifted from the poor to the rich.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The President next turned his attention to the banks.

This Act was signed in September,\n1916, but did not come into force until September, 1917.  While\nthese things were being done within the country troubles beyond\nits boarders were increasing.  First there was trouble with Mexico.</p><p>A few days before Mr.  Wilson was inaugurated, Madero, the President of\nMexico, was deposed and murdered, and a rebel leader named Huerta\nat once proclaimed himself President.  That he had anything to do\nwith the murder of Madero has never been openly proved, but Mr.\nWilson, believing that he had, looked upon him as an assassin, and\nrefused to acknowledge him as head of the neighboring republic.  But\nbeyond that Mr.  Wilson hesitated to mix himself or his country in\nthe Mexican quarrel, believing that the Mexicans themselves could\nbest settle their own affairs.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Shall we deny to Mexico,\" he asked, a little later,</p>",
  "page-1188": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"because she\nis weak, the right to settle her own affairs? No, I say.

The trouble is too close to us.  It is not settled yet.\nBut the one thing we can clearly see is that Mr.  Wilson loved and\ndesired peace, not only with Mexico but with the whole of America.\nHe wanted to unite the whole of America, both North and South, in\nbonds of kindness.  He wanted to make the small weak republics of\nSouth America feel that the great republic of North America was\na watchful friend, and not a watchful enemy, eager, and able when\nshe chose, to crush them.  Had the United States put forth her\nstrength, Mexico could have been conquered, doubtless, in no long\ntime.  But Mr.  Wilson took a wider view than those who counseled such\na course. </p>",
  "page-1189": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Instead of crushing Mexico, and thereby perhaps arousing\nthe jealousy and suspicion of other weak republics, he tried to\nuse the trouble to increase the good will of these republics toward\nthe United States.

Whether the means he used were wise or not time\nwill show.</p><p>For the most part the country was with the President in his desire\nto keep out of war with Mexico.  This was partly because they believed\nthat America was not prepared for war, partly because they knew\nthat war must certainly end in the defeat of the Mexicans.  Having\ndefeated them the United States would be forced to annex their\nterritory, and this no one wanted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But to keep out of war was no easy matter.
